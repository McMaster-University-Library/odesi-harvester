"ABC News Post-Election Poll #1, November 2000  ",2000,ABC News,"This special topic poll, fielded November 12, 2000, is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues. This data collection focused on the presidential election that took place on November 7, 2000. Respondents were asked about the extent of their personal interest in and concern about the situation in the country five days after the election. Questions examined opinions on the way various groups were handling the election, including Vice President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's campaigns, local officials in Florida, and the news media. Respondents were also asked whom they wanted to see become the next president. Opinions were elicited on the need for a new presidential election in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the entire state of Florida, in other states where election results were very close, and across the entire country. Additional topics covered whether George W. Bush and Al Gore should accept the recount in Florida or should ask courts to look into whether the voting was unfair and if they should ask for a recount in other states where the results were very close. Those polled expressed their views about electing the president by direct popular vote versus by the Electoral College, their confidence about the accuracy of Florida's recount, and whether the ballot that was used in Palm Beach County was fair. The survey also investigated what impact the unclear post-election situation would have, especially on the country's system of presidential elections. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, partyaffiliation, political orientation, and voter registration.","ABC News.

For the first major area of focus, poverty and social exclusion, the survey queried respondents about their own definition of poverty, the extent of poverty and homelessness in their area, and whether or not respondents believed poverty had increased in their area and elsewhere. Respondents were queried about what necessities people must be able to afford to meet a minimal acceptable living standard, who is most at risk for poverty, as well as the social, political, and personal causes of poverty and homelessness. Respondents were also asked about how poverty impacts peoples’ chances of completing certain activities, such as getting a good education or finding a job. Respondents were then asked whether or not they trust the European Union (EU), their governments, charities, other citizens, and miscellaneous institutions to effectively respond to poverty. Respondents were also asked to whom they assign primary responsibility for reducing or preventing poverty, what policies their governments should focus on in the future in the effort to help people out of poverty, and whether or not respondents approved of their government’s existing anti-poverty measures. Respondents were also queried about their perception of social tensions between groups, and about what they have done personally to help poor people. Additionally, respondents were queried about their own living conditions, satisfaction with life, ability to keep a job, efforts to fight poverty, finances, and their own risk of falling into poverty. For the second major area of focus, mobile phone use, the survey asked respondents about whether or not they owned a mobile phone, their mobile phone use in other EU countries, and the cost of cellular phone service in those countries. For the third major area of focus, economic crisis, the survey questioned respondents about the degree to which the crisis personally affected them, how the crisis affected the EU and its policy efforts, who should bear responsibility for the crisis, who should bear the burden of response to the crisis, and how the European Parliament and other bodies should respond to the crisis. For the fourth major area of focus, international trade, the survey queried respondents on whether they pay attention to the country of origin for products they purchase, how trade impacts respondents and their countries, what European Union trade policy should be going into the future, and the European Union’s international economic standing. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.

The focus was not only on the attitudes and experiences of students of color (Asian American, Latino/Hispanic, African American and Native American students) but on the contribution of diversity to the broader intellectual experiences of White students as well. The longitudinal design of the Michigan Study allowed for consideration of what students bring to the university at entrance, as well as documenting important changes as they move toward graduation. One set of questions addressed the general undergraduate experience of students at the University of Michigan, the positive and negative aspects of their experiences with faculty, interactions with fellow students, extracurricular involvements, reactions to their academic and intellectual experiences, and how similar or different the experiences of students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds were. Another set of questions dealt with the racial ""climate"" on campus, the degree of racial tension, the students' perceptions of and responses to the University's commitment to multiculturalism and diversity, the perceptions and views that students brought to the campus and how much they were affected and changed by their experiences at the University of Michigan, the positive aspects and specific arenas of concern for the various groups of students around multiculturalism, and the relevancy of the University's commitment tomulticulturalism and diversity.","Gurin, Gerald, and John Matlock.

"Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada : Wave 2",2002,Statistics Canada,"There exists a growing need for information on recent immigrants to Canada. As part of adapting to life in Canada, many immigrants face challenges such as finding suitable accommodation, learning or becoming more fluent in one or both of Canada's official languages, participating in the labour market or accessing education and training opportunities. The results of this survey will provide indicators of how immigrants are meeting these and other challenges. While integration may take many years, the LSIC is designed to examine the first four years of settlement, a time when newcomers establish economic, social and cultural ties to Canadian society. To this end, the objectives of the survey are two-fold: to study how new immigrants adjust to life in Canada over time; and, to provide information on the factors that can facilitate or hinder this adjustment.Topics covered in the survey include language proficiency, housing, education, foreign credential recognition, employment, health, values and attitudes, the development and use of social networks, income, and perceptions of settlement in Canada. Since immigration is a shared jurisdiction between national and provincial departments the information gathered through the LSIC will be beneficial to many groups including both federal and provincial government departments, immigrant settlement agencies, non-governmental organizations and researchers. Survey results will also play an important role in planning and developing programs that will assist future immigrants settling in Canada.Note that a public use microdata file will not be created for this survey. Data from the survey may be accessed through Statistics Canada's Research Data Centres (RDC).

"Survey of Stratification and Migration Dynamics in Russia, 1985-2001",1985,"Gerber, Theodore P.","The purpose of the study was to collect survey data on the employment/work histories, family structure histories, and residential mobility histories of Russian adults from January 1985 through the end of the survey. The work histories include the following information about each job held during that time period: occupation, how the job was found, employer type, industry, and size. In addition, the survey gathered information on current residence, occupation, other job characteristics, earnings, sources of household income, household ownership of consumer goods, basic demographic indicators, and attitude measures. The data were designed to be used for multivariate analysis of the factors influencing changes in employment status, job mobility of various types, changes in marital status, fertility, and residential mobility in Russia during the period of 1985-2001. Since the period covered by the histories spans the final seven years of the Soviet era and the first decade of the post-Soviet era, the data are uniquely suited for assessing whether the transition from Soviet-style socialism has affected stratification, family formation, and migration processes. Moreover, because the data include work/employment, family structure, and migration histories, the dataset is uniquely suited for dynamic analyses of the inter-relationships among states and events in these three domains. Finally, because the data contain information on each respondent's oblast (region) of residence at all points in time from 1985-2001, data on regional characteristics can be merged with files created from the survey data, in order to measure the impact of regional characteristics on individual-level events. The data can be used to investigate job and employment transitions, union formation and dissolution, fertility, departures of children, internal migration, determinants of earnings, wage arrears, consumption, andother topics.","Gerber, Theodore P.

Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p><p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing.

To  evaluate the 75 largest counties in the nation, 33 counties were  chosen. The ranking of these counties was based on a combination of  crime data and population data. The criteria for including a case on a  roster from which cases would be sampled was that (1) one or more  defendants must have been arrested for murder and (2) the case must  have been adjudicated during 1988. These cases were a sample of about  half of all those in the 33 counties studied that had a murder charge  brought to the prosecutors in 1988, or earlier, and that were disposed  during 1988. When statistically weighted, the sample cases represent a  total of 9,576 murder defendants in the nation's 75 largest counties.  Demographic information on victims and defendants includes sex, date of  birth, area of residence, and occupation.

National Cancer Institute,"This data collection is comprised of responses from two sets of survey questionnaires, the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and a survey administered as a supplement to the February 2002 questionnaire on the topic of tobacco use in the United States. The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and November 2001 (ICPSR 4044). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","United States.

Variables about the neighborhood surrounding the school and if there are problems with theft, vandalism, drugs, sexual assault, simple assault, trash, abandoned vehicles, and traffic are also included. Respondents were asked if they felt their child was safe at school and if the child felt safe at school. Respondents were also asked if they had ever picked up their child from school during school hours, why the child was picked up, and if they thought the visitor sign- in and child sign-out procedures were efficient and sufficient. Other variables were included to gauge the respondents' familiarity with different types of technologies such as cell phones, computers, and voice-mail. Finally, respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition program (T-PASS) that was being implemented in the New Egypt Schools.Dataset 5, the second parent survey, includes the same variables as Dataset 4, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system.  Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS or the buzzer to enter the school, the ease of use of T-PASS and the buzzer, the level of security that was provided by T-PASS and the buzzer, and if they had experienced any problems using either T-PASS or the buzzer.  Respondents were also asked if they had used T-PASS to sign a child out of the school, the ease of use of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, the security level of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, and problems they experienced using T-PASS to sign a child out of the school. Dataset 6, the first teacher survey, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, current position, highest level of education, years working in Plumsted Township schools and if less than five years where previously worked. Respondents were asked which school they worked in and if the school had problems with issues such as fighting, absenteeism, tardiness, bullying, theft, vandalism, drug, alcohol or tobacco use by students, and possession of weapons by students. Respondents were asked if they felt safe at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood and if they thought the children felt safe at the school and in surrounding neighborhood. Respondents were asked how many times per day they left the school during school hours, the reason for leaving and if they used a swipe card to enter the building. Variables were also included to gauge the respondents' use of technologies such as cell phones, voice-mail, and computers.  Finally, the respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition system (T-PASS) being implemented at the schools.The second teacher survey, Dataset 7, includes the same variables as Dataset 6, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system. Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS, to compare T-PASS to the buzzer and the swipe card systems in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had experienced any problems using T-PASS. Respondents were also asked if they had used the buzzer system to enter the school, to compare the buzzer system to T-PASS in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had any problems while trying to use the buzzer system. Finally, respondents were asked if they had gained entry into the school through other means, and to describe the other means of entry used.","Uchida, Craig D., Edward R. Maguire, Shellie E.

"Leisure, lifestyle, and lifecyle project (LLLP): A longitudinal study of gambling in Alberta [Canada]",2006,"Williams, Robert J.","<p><em>The Leisure, Lifestyle, and Lifecycle Project (LLLP)</em> is a five-year longitudinal study that was conducted by the Alberta Gambling Research Institute (AGRI). Prior to the LLLP, knowledge of problem gambling risk factors had been derived mainly from cross-sectional and retrospective studies of people coping with disordered gambling. This project was developed with the understanding that prevention and early intervention services for disordered gambling could be better informed by a rigorous longitudinal study of the natural progression of gambling in the general population.</p><p>In order to examine the determinants and the course of both non-problematic gambling and problem gambling, the LLLP surveys collected data on a number of gambling-specific and general aspects of the responders' lives. The LLLP contains data relating to gambling-specific information, including:</p><ul><li>demographics;</li><li>past year and lifetime gambling behaviour;</li><li>gambling attitudes and beliefs in gambling fallacies;</li><li>motivations for gambling;</li><li>stigma experienced from gambling; and</li><li>family history of gambling.</li></ul><p>In addition to gambling-specific data, the LLLP survey contains a number of general data variables, including:</p><ul><li>general/physical health;</li><li>psychological factors (personality and temperament, psychopathology, coping strategies);</li><li>comorbid factors (ADHD, eating disorders, substance use disorders);</li><li>cultural factors (religiosity) and;</li><li>social factors (social support/networks, non-gambling activity participation).</li></ul><p>A sample of 1,808 participants was recruited from four diverse regions of Alberta: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, and Grand Prairie. Participants were recruited primarily by random digit dialing, and five critical age ranges were targeted (13-15, 18-20, 23-25, and 63-65 year-olds) in order to assess problem gambling development throughout the lifespan. There are two separate LLLP datasets: one for adolescents (<em>n=</em>436) and another for adults (<em>n=</em>1,372). Data were collected over four waves, with a retention rate of 71.8% for adolescents and 76.2% for adults. A subsequent wave, combining adolescent and adult participants, was undertaken in 2013-2014.

"Impact of Legislation to Prohibit 'Happy Hours' in Indiana, 1983-1986",1983,"Maxfield, Michael G.","This research program was undertaken in Indiana to evaluate  the effectiveness of legislation that prohibited ""happy hours,"" the  sale of alcoholic beverages at reduced prices during specified times.  The happy hour ban sought to curb abusive drinking that can occur when  alcoholic beverages are served at significantly reduced prices for a  limited time only. The goal of the data collection was to determine  whether any reduction in automobile accidents could be attributed to  the ban on happy hours. Researchers used an interrupted time-series  design to observe trends over time. Data used in this evaluation were  extracted from the Accident Statistical Master Tapes for 1983 through  1986 for the state of Indiana, which include annual compilations of all  accidents. Variables measure the number of accidents during the  specified times. The first data file has as its unit of analysis weeks,  defined as beginning Monday and ending on Friday.

Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them. Additional questions asked respondents whether they had any close friends or relatives who filed for bankruptcy or had a foreclosure in the past year, whether they had any money invested in the stock market, and whether they thought investment in the stock market was safe.  Other topics addressed the war in Iraq, the home mortgage crisis, estate and income tax, trade restrictions, and race relations. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, employment status, marital status, whether respondents had children under 18 years of age, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","CBS News, and The New York Times.

SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospectiveobservational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlledclinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data frompatients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care,treatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making amongcritically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step fordevising an intervention strategy for improving critically-illpatients' care and for the construction of statistical models forpredicting patient prognosis and functional status. An interventionwas implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patientsduring 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians withaccurate predictive information on future functional ability, survivalprobability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-lifecare. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of theintervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhanceunderstanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advanceplanning. The intervention was expected to increase communication,resulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation,decrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in theIntensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increasephysician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decreasepatient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection inboth phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered topatients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews forabstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase IIalso collected information regarding the implementation of theintervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nursesassigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patientswere followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those whodid not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matchedagainst the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. TheHELP study was conducted in 1993 concomitantly with Phase II ofSUPPORT and collected data to characterize the care, treatmentpreferences, and patterns of decision-making among hospitalizedpatients who were at least 80 years old. HELP data were also intendedfor use in adapting existing mortality and functional status models ofelderly hospitalized patients. Data collection methods of HELP wereessentially the same as those of SUPPORT. HELP patients were followedfor 12 months after inclusion in the study.

"Labour Force Survey, November 2008 [Canada] [Rebased]",2008,Labour Statistics Division,"<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p><p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p><p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The ""Sysmiss"" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the ""Valid"" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p><p>LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>","Statistics Canada. 2008.

"Public Use Data (2008-10) on Neighborhood Effects on Obesity and Diabetes Among Low-Income Adults from the All Five Sites of the Moving to Opportunity Experiment",2014,"McDade, Thomas W.","Nearly 9 million Americans live in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, places that also tend to be racially segregated and dangerous. Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of ""neighborhood"" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.","Ludwig, Jens, Lisa Sanbonmatsu, Lisa A.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada.

Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality,"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.

The overall research questions of this study include: (1) how demographic and socioeconomic processes at the household level, e.g. those related to family structures and livelihood systems, affect local residents' resource exploitation patterns and land use practices; (2) how local residents respond to shifts in government policy, especially the implementation of two nationwide conservation programs, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), in WNR; and (3) how household and policy dynamics interact to affect the natural environment of WNR. Example hypotheses tested in this study concerned: (1) the effects of conservation policies on local households' energy consumption patterns and fuelwood collection behaviors; (2) the connection between a household's demographic and socioeconomic background and its responses to conservation policies; (3) the relationships between social networks and labor migration; (4) the factors that affect a household's participation in nature-based tourism and the distribution of tourism benefits among different households; and (5) the potential implication of the processes described above on wildlife habitat change and conservation.

Florida DOH and FCDS began receiving these hospital records and processing/linking them with other administrative databases between December 2011 and August, 2012.  Under the guidance of Florida DOH, the Florida Cancer Data System is the organizational producer of this pilot study dataset.The study tables created for this project contain data for 11,506 unique breast cancer patients who were diagnosed and/or treated between 2007-2011 at a partnering Florida hospital.  Patient hospital EMRs were linked with Florida cancer registry data.  Other administrative databases were linked for updated hospital admissions/discharge records and mortality information from across the state.The study database consists of hospital records for patient clinical characteristics, health histories, comorbid conditions for which specific treatment modalities are provided, including chemotherapy and radiation, medications orders, as well as the treatment doses administered on specific dates and times.  These hospital data also contain clinicians' notes during hospitalizations and at the time of discharge, pathology reports were generated for patient laboratory tests performed.  Financial charges for services provided to patients were collected from the hospital billing department.Other state administrative records merged for these study tables include routinely collected data from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), hospital discharge data and ambulatory records maintained by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and mortality data collected by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics.Pilot study data tables contain discrete and text data which include raw numeric values from hospital medical records, and include clinical notations retained in patient pathology reports and discharge summaries.  A subset of all transmitted EMR records were created consisting of admission (event) records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Hospital discharge data and ambulatory surgical data were collected as routinely collected administrative data. Patient's death information was collected from state death certificate data. United States Census data were used to categorize patient socioeconomic strata.","Huang, Youjie.

The questions in the 1958 survey covered the respondent's attitudes toward national economic conditions and price activity, as well as the respondent's own financial situation. Other questions examined the spending unit head's occupation, and the nature and amount of the spending unit's income, debts, liquid assets, changes in liquid assets, savings, investment preferences, and actual and expected purchases of cars and other major durables. The survey also elicited respondent's attitudes about different methods of using income remaining after expenses were met, e.g., investing in stocks or putting money in savings. In addition, the survey explored in detail the subject of housing, e.g., previous and present home ownership, value of respondent's dwelling, and mortgage information.  Respondents also were asked for the details of the head's employment (e.g., full- or part-time and number of weeks in the year employed) and unemployment status.

This data collection was undertaken to assess public opinion prior to President Bill Clinton's second-term inauguration as president of the United States. Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Clinton and his handling of the first term of his presidency, whether he would do a better or worse job in his second term in office, whether they approved of his choices for Cabinet and other top positions in his administration, and what the nature of his relationship with Congress should be in his second term. Views were sought on whether President Clinton had made progress toward reducing unemployment and improving education during his first term, and whether he would make substantial progress in these areas during his second term. Respondents rated the most important issue facing the country, whether they were better or worse off financially compared to four years ago, whether they approved of the way Congress was handling its job, whether they expected Congress to do a better job in the next two years, and whether they trusted the Clinton administration or the Republicans in Congress to handle the main problems the nation would face over the next few years. Other questions asked whether respondents approved of the way Hillary Clinton was handling her job as first lady and the amount of influence she held over her husband, and whether she should play a greater role in her husband's second administration. A series of questions asked about recent allegations involving President Clinton, including Whitewater, the Democratic National Campaign Committee's acceptance of foreign contributions, and former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones's sexual harassment charges, and whether they would interfere with his ability to serve as president. Additional topics addressed what actions the government should take to protect the long-term financial stability of Social Security and the Medicare health system and the overall level of ethics and honesty in politics and the federal government.

Health Resources and Services Administration,"The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) currently requires that all ADAPs report aggregate data quarterly using the ADAP Quarterly Report (AQR). However, aggregate data limits HAB's ability to respond to inquiries from Congress and other stakeholders regarding the ADAP program. To address this limitation, HAB has developed a new data reporting system, the ADAP Data Report (ADR). The ADR will enable HAB toevaluate the impact of the ADAP program on a national level. The ADR will allow HAB to characterize the individuals using the program, describe the ADAP-funded services being used, and delineate the costs associated with these services.ADAPs will begin collecting data for the ADR in October 2012. However, because the ADR is new, grantees will continue to submit the AQR until they become accustomed to the ADR and the quality of the information provided through the ADR accurately represents the program. At that time, the AQR will be retired.HAB's goal is to have a client-level data reporting system that provides data on the characteristics of theADAPs and the clients served with program funds. The ADAP client-level data submitted will be used to:- Monitor the clinical outcomes of clients receiving care and treatment through ADAP;- Monitor the use of ADAP funds for appropriately addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States;- Monitor the support provided by ADAP to the most vulnerable, especially minority communities;- Address the needs and concerns of Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the RWHAP; and- Monitor the outcomes achieved in response to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.","United States Department of Health and Human Services.

"Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating, 2010 [Canada]: Giving File",2010,Statistics Canada. Special Surveys Division  ,"The Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating 2010 is the latest iteration of a series of surveys that began with the National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and participating. It was conducted by Statistics Canada in 1997 as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey, and was repeated in the fall of 2000. In 2001, the federal government provided funding to establish a permanent survey program on charitable giving, volunteering and participating within Statistics Canada. The survey itself was renamed the Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP). The CSGVP was developed through a partnership of federal government departments and voluntary sector organizations. These include Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, Imagine Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Statistics Canada and Volunteer Canada. There are two data files for the 2010 Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP): the main answer file (MAIN.TXT), and the giving file (GS.TXT). For most questions in the CSGVP questionnaire, the reference period was the 12 months preceding the interview. For the provincial component, interviews were conducted from September 14th to December 10th, 2010. The territorial or northern component interviews took place during same time period as the provincial component.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/odesi/csgvp-E-2010-giving.xml
"Current Population Survey, November 2003: Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), 2003 Wave",2003,United States Department of Health and Human Services. National Institutes of Health. National Cancer Institute,"This data collection is comprised of responses from two sets of survey questionnaires, the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and a survey administered as a supplement to the November 2003 questionnaire on the topic of tobacco use in the United States. The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in February 2003 (ICPSR 4526) and June 2003 (ICPSR 4527). These three supplements comprise the 2003 wave of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.The TUS, like most CPS supplements, was designed to be a proxy response supplement, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members, provided the respondent was a household member 15 years of age or older. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent supplement questions. All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS core items were eligible for the November 2003 supplement items.The TUS consisted of items PEA1 through PEK5. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for certain items. Information was collected from proxies on topics such as smoking status (items PEA1-PEA3) and the use of other tobacco-related products, such as pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PEJ1a-PEJ2a).In addition to these smoking status and other tobacco use questions, self-respondents were queried on the following topics depending on their smoking/tobacco use status (i.e., every day, some days, or former cigarette smokers and/or users of other non-cigarette tobacco products):Smoking historyCurrent cigarette smoking prevalence and consumptionType of cigarettes smokedPrice of last pack/carton of cigarettes purchased and state where purchasedMedical and dental advice to quit smokingAttempts and intentions to quit smoking cigarettes and/or other forms of tobacco useWorkplace smoking policies and smoking rules in the homeAttitudes toward smoking in public placesAnother generally unique feature to the 2003 TUS-CPS was the administration of questions to former smokers on their previous level of addiction, products/resources/methods used to quit smoking, and advice from healthprofessionals. This feature enables comparisons between characteristics of former smokers (or successful quitters) and current smokers attempting to quit.Administrative information was collected on who the proxyrespondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected include age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","United States.

"Child Care and Development Fund Administrative Data, [United States], Federal Fiscal Year 2015",2014,United States Department of Health and Human Services. Administration for Children and Families. Office of Child Care,"This administrative dataset provides descriptive information about the families and children served through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). CCDF dollars are provided to states, territories, and tribes to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, or depending on their state's policy, to attend training or receive education. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 requires states and territories to collect information on all family units receiving assistance through the CCDF and to submit monthly case-level data to the Office of Child Care. States are permitted to report case-level data for the entire population, or a sample of the population, under approved sampling guidelines.The Summary Records file contains monthly state-level summary information including the number of families served. The Family Records file contains family-level data including single parent status of the head of household, monthly co-payment amount, date on which child care assistance began, reasons for care (e.g., employment, training/education, protective services, etc.), income used to determine eligibility, source of income, and the family size on which eligibility is based. The Child Records file contains child-level data including ethnicity, race, gender, and date of birth. The Setting Records file contains information about the type of child care setting, the total amount paid to the provider, and the total number of hours of care received by the child. The Pooling Factor file provides state-level data on the percentage of child care funds that is provided through the CCDF, the federal Head Start region the grantee (state) is in and is monitored by, and the state FIPS code for the grantee.","United States Department of Health and Human Services.

"National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010",2010,United States Department of Justice. Office of Justice Programs. Bureau of Justice Statistics,"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as ""personal"" or ""property."" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A ""household respondent"" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","United States Department of Justice.

"Homicide, Bereavement, and the Criminal Justice System in Texas, 2000",2000,"Goodrum, Sarah Dugan","Data were obtained from in-depth interviews conducted June through December 2000 with two different groups of people. The first group represented individuals who had lost loved ones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts 1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised of county criminal justice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court judges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates). Names and contact information for the bereaved interviews were obtained from: (1) death certificate records furnished by the Texas Department of Health, (2) local newspaper articles, and (3) victim/witness counselors with the county District Attorney's Office. Individuals were asked to participate in the study via letters or telephone calls. The interviews allowed interviewees to talk about their experiences in their own words. Each interview lasted, on average, two-and-a-half hours. When the interview continued for more than two hours, the interviewer scheduled a second meeting. Those interviewees living out of state were interviewed via the telephone, while in-person interviews took place at the bereaved respondent's place of residence, local restaurants, or in the office of the interviewer. There was one non-English speaking bereaved, whose interview was conducted with the help of a Spanish-English interpreter who also transcribed the interview. For Parts 34-55, interviews were conducted with county criminal justice professionals. These interviews took approximately an hour to complete and took place in the professional's office, place of residence, or at local restaurants.

"Canadian Internet Use Survey, 2012 [Canada]: Household File",2012,Special Surveys Division,"<p>The Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS) was conducted for the first time in 2005, replacing the Household Internet Use Survey (HIUS). The HIUS had been conducted on a biennial basis from 1997 to 2003 to measure household Internet use. As growth in the number of households using the Internet leveled off, the survey was redesigned to focus on how individuals, rather than households, are using the Internet. The individual-level CIUS was conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009.<p/> <p>For 2010, the CIUS was redesigned to meet the measurement needs of the Broadband Canada: Connecting Rural Canadians Program, sponsored by Industry Canada. For the first time, the redesigned survey incorporated a hybrid design, consisting of both a Household Component and an Individual Component. <p/> <p>The 2012 CIUS was conducted under the 2010 design. <p/> <p>The Household Component includes a short series of questions on the type of Internet connections and devices used by household members, from home, as well as availability of high speed service, and a standard module on household income. The questions may be answered by any knowledgeable member of the household. <p/> <p>Following the Household Component, an individual aged 16 years and older was randomly selected to complete the Individual Component. Respondents were asked about their use of the Internet, and online activities including electronic commerce. While the Household Component covered Internet access at home, the Individual Component covers use of the Internet from any location. <p/> <p>The Individual Component begins with a module on Current User (CU) of the Internet. As in past years, the CIUS asks individuals about their locations of Internet use, frequency and intensity of use, and reasons for non-use. The Specific Use (SU) module, as in 2010, asks respondents to report their Internet activities. These activities cover a wide range of topics including the use of email, instant messaging, formal education, and the search for employment. As with the 2010 survey, these activities could have taken place from any location and using any device. <p/> <p>The Electronic Commerce (EC) module collects information on the total number, the total cost, and the types of goods and services ordered over the internet. Additional information is also collected on the location of delivery, the means of payment, and the main reason for not participating in e-commerce. This module remained consistent with the 2010 survey. <p/> <p>The Privacy and Security (PS) module includes questions about online behaviour (e.g., use of security software, frequency of backing up files) and experiences related to security (e.g., experienced a computer virus). For the 2012 survey, this module was slightly modified with the addition of questions regarding concern for security while using internet banking or credit cards online. <p/> <p>As the 2010 and the 2012 surveys have two distinct components - household and individual - with revised and streamlined questions, it is not appropriate to make direct comparisons with results from previous years. Data users who have questions about the survey are invited to contact the Investment, Science and Technology Division (please refer to Chapter 1.0 for contact information). <p/>","Statistics Canada. 2012.

"Transitional Aid Research Project (TARP), 1976-1977",1976,"Lenihan, Kenneth J.","The Transitional Aid Research Project (TARP) was arandomized field experiment conducted in Texas and Georgia in1976-1977 that was designed to reduce recidivism among ex-prisoners bylowering incentives for re-engaging in property crime throughprovision of minimal levels of income support and extension of someunemployment insurance coverage to released prisoners. This studyevolved out of an earlier LIFE (Living Insurance for Ex-Prisoners)study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1970s. In the LIFEstudy, 500 prisoners with a high probability of re-arrest wererandomly assigned at release from prison to experimental and controlgroups which varied by the amount of money received (contingent uponemployment or unemployment and job placement services provided). Theresults showed that ex-prisoners receiving payments were less likelyto be re-arrested for property theft-related crimes than those whoreceived only job placement or no services or payments of anykind. The United States Department of Labor commissioned the TARPexperiment, designed to replicate the LIFE experiment while providinga larger and more representative sample of prisoners, greatervariation in treatment conditions, and administration of payments and jobplacement services through existing agencies rather than by a specialpurpose project staff. Texas and Georgia were the states chosen forthe experiment, and stratified random samples of inmates wereassigned, at the time of release from prison, to experimental andcontrol groups. The groups varied in the amount of money and jobplacement services they received upon their release. Originally, thedata were recorded in nine files for each state corresponding to eachof the nine different sources of information for each TARP case. TheICPSR data collection combines these into one file for each state:Part 1 for Texas, and Part 2 for Georgia. Each file contains over1,500 variables, clustered in nine topic areas for each inmate: (1)prison history (e.g., background information, psychological andaptitude test data, and prior criminal and present incarcerationactivity), (2-5) data from four personal interviews (conducted at theprerelease, three-month, six-month, and 12-month stages and thatinclude living arrangements, employment history, and financialstatus), (6) state arrest data, (7) records of TARP payments received,(8) social security wages, and (9) parole records.","Rossi, Peter, Richard A.

Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate).

Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited and length of stay. The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries.

"Public Service Employee Survey, 2002",2002,Statistics Canada,"The primary objective of the survey is to obtain the views of all employees of the federal Public Service about their workplaces. The information will allow managers and employees to initiate concrete actions in their own department, and where warranted, across the Public Service. The effects of Program Review, government restructuring, increased workload and rapid technological advances have greatly affected federal Public Service employees. Recent studies and reports on specific segments of the federal Public Service had shown that low morale was prevalent among executives and knowledge workers and that many employees felt that workplace conditions were not conducive to confidence in management, job satisfaction and career advancement. Much additional information was required in order to further evaluate these findings and determine how the present workplace structure could be improved to meet the challenges facing it at the turn of the new millennium.In 1997, the Clerk of the Privy Council introduced the idea of a voluntary survey of all federal Public Service employees. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) was asked to implement the project. The TBS worked in consultation with other key federal departments to develop a national survey that would gather information from all employees through a common questionnaire. As part of the project, Statistics Canada was asked to participate in the development and to collect and process the data. The survey results will be used to develop actions at the level of the department, sector or branch and ultimately at the work unit level. The results would also serve as input to the future corporate management agenda.

This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Zimbabwe. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his administration's overall performance, to state the most important issues facing the nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the media, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, the inclusiveness of the government, and the identification of causes of conflict and resources that may aid in the resolution of conflict. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities are fair. Societal questions were asked of respondents concerning the meaning of being ""poor"" and ""rich,"" monetary support systems, personal responsibility for success or failure, characteristics used in self-identification, methods for securing food, water, schooling, medical services, news and information, and ease of obtaining assistance for certain services. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether respondent was head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, language used in interview, and type of physical disability, if any.

The data generated from the responses to the supplement will provide input to determine the rates for quota reductions for qualified employers. Although the Absence from Work Survey collects information on absences from work due to illness, accident or pregnancy, it does not provide a complete picture of people who have been absent from work for these reasons because the concepts and definitions have been developed specifically for the needs of the client.

The survey collects new information about the factors, influences and processes that contribute to healthy aging through a multidisciplinary approach focusing on health, social and economic determinants. The survey focuses on the health of Canadians aged 45 and over by examining the various factors that impact healthy aging, such as general health and well-being, physical activity, use of health care services, social participation, as well as work and retirement transitions.Policy makers, researchers and planners are aware that planning for the future of an aging population is an important activity now and in the coming years. This survey will help them make informed decisions regarding health care, social services and income support programs that will affect all Canadians. The specific objectives of the survey are: 1. To better understand the aging process of people aged 45 and over by collecting data on various aspects of their health and well being, use of health care services, social support and participation and work and retirement transitions. 2. To examine how lifestyle determinants affect health as people age.3. To examine the links among healthy aging and social, demographic, geographic and economic variables or characteristics using a multidisciplinary approach.4. To provide information on successful aging by age group and sex.Data users will include Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial ministries and departments of health, the Institut de la statistique du Québec, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, and academic researchers in a variety of disciplines such as gerontology and public health.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dlimf/ca-statcan-47963.xml
"Labour Force Historical Review, 2009 [Canada] [B2020]",1976,Statistics Canada,"<p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household survey carried out monthly by Statistics Canada. Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.</p> <p>Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:</p> <ol> <li>The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.</li> <li>There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors forthis period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.</li> <li>The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour market trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.</li> </ol> <p>The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.</p>","Statistics Canada, 2016, ""Labour Force Historical Review, 2009 [Canada] [B2020]"", hdl:10864/11224, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1",social sciences; absence from work; accommodation service industry; administrative personnel; age; agriculture; applied sciences; arts; beverage industries; business enterprises; census metropolitan areas; child care responsibilities; children; class of worker; construction trades; contractual services; culture; demographic characteristics; divorced persons; divorces; economic families; economic regions; education; educational attainment; educational services; educators; employment; equipment; female lone parent families; finance; fishing; food services; forestry industries; full time employment; gasoline; goodsproducing industries; government; healthcare; health personnel; high school education; historical data; home care; hours of work; hours worked; industries; information; insurance; job tenure; jobs; labour force; labour supply; length of unemployment; lone parent families; lone parents; machinery; male lone parent families; managers; manufacturing industries; manufacturing processes; marital status; marriages; medical specialists; mining; multiple jobholders; natural sciences; not in the labour force; nurses; occupations; oil wells; paid overtime; part time employment; postsecondary education; primary industries; professional services; provincial differences; public administration; public utilities; real estate; recreation; rentals and leasing services; retailers; salaries and wages; sales staff; seasonal adjustment; secretaries; security guards; separated persons; services; sex; social assistance; social sciences and humanities; social services; sports; support staff; technical personnel; transport industries; type of work; unattached individuals; unemployment; unemployment spells; unionized workers; unions; warehouses; wholesale merchants,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dataverse_sp/hdl--10864_11224.xml

Reported data were used when available. Otherwise, data were extracted from published figures using the Web Plot Digitizer tool. Where summary data on median, and interquartile range was presented, mean and standard deviation was estimated. Variables with multi-temporal data (e.g. soil moisture) were summarised using the mean and pooled standard deviation to provide an aggregated value per site per year.

"Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions",2018,"Pavlidis, Paul","Protein interactions shape proteome function and thus biology. Identification of protein interactions is a major goal in molecular biology, but biochemical methods, although improving, remain limited in coverage and accuracy. Whereas computational predictions can guide biochemical experiments, low validation rates of  predictions remain a major limitation. Here, we investigated computational methods in the prediction of a specific type of interaction, the inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors. Proteases generate thousands of proteoforms that dynamically shape the functional state of proteomes. Despite the important regulatory role of proteases, knowledge of their inhibitors remains largely incomplete with the vast majority of proteases lacking an annotated inhibitor. To link inhibitors to their target proteases on a large scale, we applied computational methods to predict inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors based on complementary data including coexpression, phylogenetic similarity, structural information, co-annotation, and colocalization, and also surveyed general protein interaction networks for potential inhibitory interactions. In testing nine predicted interactions biochemically, we validated the inhibition of kallikrein 5 by serpin B12. Despite the use of a wide array of complementary data, we found a high false positive rate of computational predictions in biochemical follow-up. Based on a protease-specific definition of true negatives derived from the biochemical classification of proteases and inhibitors, we analyzed prediction accuracy of individual features. Thereby we identified feature-specific limitations, which also affected general protein interaction prediction methods. Interestingly, proteases were often not coexpressed with most of their functional inhibitors, contrary to what is commonly assumed and extrapolated predominantly from cell culture experiments. Predictions of inhibitory interactions were indeed more challenging than predictions of non-proteolytic and non-inhibitory interactions. In summary, we describe a novel and well-defined but difficult protein interaction prediction task, and thereby highlight limitations of computational interaction prediction methods.","Fortelny N, Butler GS, Overall CM, Pavlidis P.

Those who were registered to vote were asked about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus that year, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election and for whom, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location. Other questions addressed respondent's willingness to participate in an exit poll or post-election telephone survey. After the election, 1,220 adults were re-interviewed in a call-back poll conducted November 7-10, 2008. Respondents who had voted were asked who they had voted for, when they had finally decided on a candidate, the main reason they chose that candidate, which voting method they used, how long they had waited in line to vote, and whether they were contacted by a presidential campaign. Those who did not vote were asked about the main reason they did not vote. All respondents in the call-back poll were asked whether progress had been made against racial discrimination since the 1960s, whether they were pleased with the outcome of the election, and their views on the upcoming Obama presidency.

These issues require skills separate fromdata analysis. NIBRS data as formatted by the FBI are stored in asingle file. These data are organized by various segment levels(record types). There are six main segment levels: administrative,offense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment levelhas a different length and layout. There are other segment levels thatoccur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significantcomputing resources are necessary to work with the data in itssingle-file format.

The projections were made using a mathematical  projection model called the cohort-component method. This method allows  separate assumptions to be made for each of the components of  population change: births, deaths, internal migration, and  international migration. The projections are consistent with the July  1, 1986 population estimates for states. In general, the projections  assume a slight increase in the national levels of fertility, an  increasing level of life expectancy, and a decreasing level of net  international migration.

Those polled were asked whether terrorism or theeconomy was a bigger problem, whether they supported the Bushadministration's policy on Iraq and the United States military presencethere, whether the number of United States military casualties wasacceptable, and how well the United States was doing in restoring orderin Iraq. Specific questions asked whether the war in Iraq was worthfighting, whether it was part of or separate from the war againstterrorism, whether it would decrease terrorism in the long run, andwhether it would be a success if Saddam Hussein was not killed orcaptured. Respondents were asked to rate the performance of groups,institutions, and individuals in dealing with the events of September11, 2001, and the war on terrorism. They were also asked to evaluate thejob done by the United States in preventing terrorist attacks, winningthe cooperation of other countries in fighting terrorism, breaking upthe al Qaeda network, improving United States intelligence, andreorganizing government agencies. Questions sought respondent views onwhether Osama bin Laden had to be captured or killed in order to win thewar on terrorism, and whether other countries had done enough to supportthe United States campaign against terrorism. Respondents were asked tocomment on their feelings about the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001, how often they thought about it, whether it changed the UnitedStates and the respondent's life, whether the changes were long- orshort-term, big or small, positive or negative, if spending time withfamily was important to them, how concerned they were about being avictim of a terrorist attack, and how concerned they were about thepossibility of more terrorist attacks in the United States. A series ofquestions addressed whether respondents worried about flying because ofthe risk of terrorism, if the respondent had flown on a commercialairplane since September 11, 2001, if airport security was better thanbefore the attacks, whether security measures were justified, theusefulness of the government's threat alert system, and whether theUnited States was safer from terrorism than before the attacks. Opinionswere also solicited on whether the United States government was doingenough to protect the rights of American citizens, Arab-Americans,non-citizens, and terrorist suspects, if the federal government wasintruding on the respondent's personal privacy rights and whether thiswas justified, and whether it was more important for the FBI toinvestigate possible terrorist threats even if it intruded on personalprivacy, or for the FBI not to intrude on personal privacy, even if itlimited its ability to investigate possible threats. Respondents werealso polled on whether they would support or oppose the federalgovernment holding suspected terrorists without trial and using physicaltorture in an attempt to get information from them.

"Human Capital Growth in a Cross Section of U.S. Metropolitan Areas",1980,"Wheeler, Christopher H.","Human capital growth, defined as the change in the fractionof a metropolitan area's labor force with a bachelor's degree, istypically viewed as generating a number of desirable outcomes,including economic growth. Yet, in spite of its importance, fewempirical studies have explored why some economies accumulate morehuman capital than others. This paper attempts to do so using a sampleof more than 200 metropolitan areas in the United States over theyears 1980, 1990, and 2000. The results reveal two consistentlysignificant correlates of human capital growth: population and theexisting stock of college-educated labor. Given that population growthand human capital growth are both positively associated witheducation, these results suggest that the geographic distributions ofpopulation and human capital should have become more concentrated inrecent decades. That is, larger, more-educated metropolitan areasshould have exhibited the fastest rates of increase in both populationand education and thus 'pulled away' from smaller, less-educationmetropolitan areas. The evidence largely supports this conclusion.","Wheeler, Christopher H. Human Capital Growth in a Cross Section of U.S. Metropolitan Areas. ICPSR01329-v1.

Asked by all states to allow comparisons between states, core questions cover attitudes and feelings about the most recent pregnancy; content and source of prenatal care; maternal alcohol and tobacco consumption; physical abuse before and during pregnancy; pregnancy-related morbidity; infant health care; and contraceptive use. State-added questions are those tailored to each state's needs. In coordination with the CDC, participating states have compiled a number of questions available to the states to add to their questionnaires as they choose.

The content of the 2000 NSGVP and its methodology are, for the most part,identical to that of the 1997 Survey. The 2000 survey is based on a representative sample of 14,724 Canadians aged 15 and over who were asked how they gave money and other resources to individuals and to organizations, volunteered time to help others and to enhance their communities, and participated in the practices of active citizenship. The survey, given its scale, provides the most comprehensive assessment of giving, volunteering and participating ever undertaken in Canada or, to the best of our knowledge, in the world. The 2000 survey replicates the 1997 survey and enables us to begin to track both changes in contributory behaviours and changes in the characteristics of those Canadians making contributions. Any trend in these behaviours has important implications for Canadian society. The results from the survey allow this report to paint a portrait of the ways Canadians contribute to society through their monetary and voluntary support of others. Charitable giving encompasses the following types of charitable giving which were measured in this survey: cash donations, in-kind donations and indirect financial support.",,activities; benefits; charities; donations; organization; training; volunteering; walkathon,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/odesi/nsgvp-89M0017-E-2000-giving-file.xml

"(Restricted) Quarterly Services Survey",2000,United States. Bureau of the Census,"The Quarterly Services Survey (QSS) is the only source of service industry indicator performance providing timely estimates of revenue and expenses for selected service industries.  The QSS is a principal economic indicator series that produces, for selected service industries, quarterly estimates of total operating revenue and the percentage of revenue by class of customer (government, business, consumers, and individuals). The survey also produces estimates of total operating expenses from tax-exempt firms in industries that have a large not-for-profit component. In addition, for hospital services, the survey estimates the number of inpatient days and discharges. The Quarterly Services survey is conducted quarterly with the mail out occurring at the end of each calendar quarter. The survey form is due 14 days after the end of the reference period. A new sample will be selected about every five to seven years. The QSS is released online, approximately every 75 days, after each calendar quarter. The sample includes approximately 19,500 service businesses with paid employees that operate in the covered sectors. Those in the sample can choose to respond though mail, fax, internet reporting, or by telephone. In order to be eligible for the list sample, service businesses must be in the Business Register (BR), which contains all Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for listed businesses and locations of multi-establishment companies. EINs may represent one or more establishments, and firms may have one or more EINs.The sample is updated quarterly to reflect births and deaths, adding new employer businesses identified in the Business and Professional Classification Survey, and deleting firms and EINs that are no longer active. During interim periods, service non-employers and businesses are represented by administrative records data or imputed values.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/icpsr/37778.xml

Because the NPHS collects data every two years and releases the data about a year after completing the collection cycle, it does not meet Health Canada's need for continuous coverage in time, rapid delivery of data, or sufficient detail of the most at-risk populations, namely 15 to 24 year olds.</p> <p> The Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey allows Health Canada to look at smoking prevalence by province-sex-age group, for age groups 15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44 and 45 and over, on a semiannual and annual basis.

The variables measured the respondents' general probation behavior as well as their behavior on probation following the treatment meetings. Data include demographic information, and variables pertaining to probation status, meeting attendance, employment information, residence information, program related concerns, and information about any contacts or responses to violations. The data include variables with information about their participation and behavior in various types of programs. In addition, variables measure the number and types of levers pulled. Other variables include the number of urine screens ordered, results of the screen, and response to positive screens, number of administrative hearings, reasons for the hearings, and response, and number of revocation hearings, reasons for the hearing, and response. The researchers also collected information about the number of meetings, telephone contacts, home visits, work visits, and the number of times probationers were involved in probation sweeps.","Chermak, Steven M.

For each of the scenarios, data are available for persons who identify with each of the following three groups: the North American Indian population, the Métis or the Inuit. <br>All three groups were projected separately for each of the ten provinces and three territories. However, the subprovincial and subterritorial level shown for the three groups varies as it depends on the groups' size. For the North American Indians, future numbers were calculated for the urban parts of all census metropolitan areas (CMAs), urban areas outside CMAs, rural areas and reserves. For the Métis, places of residence were grouped into urban parts of CMAs, urban areas outside CMAs and rural areas, which also include reserves. Because of their relatively small size, the Inuit population was projected separately for urban and rural locations only. This information is further broken down by age and sex.<br>The 18 scenarios, as well as scenario-specific assumptions on the future trend in fertility and internal migration, are presented in the table below.

"Mangrove fishes rely on emersion behavior and physiological tolerance to persist in sulfidic environments",2018,"Wright, Patricia A.","﻿Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent respiratory toxin that makes sulfidic environments tolerable to only a few organisms. We report the presence of fishes (Kryptolebias marmoratus, Poecilia orri, Gambusia sp., and Dormitator maculatus) in Belizean mangrove pools with extremely high H2S concentrations (up to 1,166 mM) that would be lethal for most fishes. Thus, we asked whether the three most prevalent species (Kryptolebias, Poecilia, and Gambusia) persist in sulfidic pools because they are exceptionally H2S tolerant and/or because they can leave water (emerse) and completely avoid H2S. We show that both physiological tolerance and emersion behavior are important. Kryptolebias demonstrated high H2S tolerance, as they lost equilibrium significantly later than Poecilia and Gambusia during H2S exposure (1,188 +/- 21 mM H2S). However, the fact that all species lost equilibrium at an ecologically relevant [H2S] suggests that physiological tolerance may suffice at moderate H2S concentrations but that another strategy is required to endure higher concentrations. In support of the avoidance behavior hypothesis, H2S elicited an emersion response in all species. Kryptolebias was most sensitive to H2S and emersed at H2S concentrations 52% and 34% lower than Poecilia and Gambusia, respectively. Moreover, H2 Sexposure caused ﻿Kryptolebias to emerse more frequently and spend more time out ofwater compared to control conditions. We suggest that physiological H2S tolerance and emersion behavior are complementary strategies. The superior H2S tolerance and amphibious capability of Kryptolebias may explain why this species was more prevalent in H2S-rich environments than other local fishes.","Rossi, Giulia S.; Tunnah, Louise; Martin, Keri E.; Turko, Andy J.; Taylor, D.

"Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey, 2002: Annual, Household File",2002,Statistics Canada. Special Surveys Division,"<p>Statistics Canada has conducted smoking surveys on an ad hoc basis on behalf of Health Canada since the 1960s. These surveys have been done as supplements to the Canadian Labour Force Survey and as Random Digit Dialling telephone surveys.</p><p>In February 1994, a change in legislation was passed which allowed a reduction in cigarette taxes. Since there was no survey data from immediately before this legislative change took place, it was difficult for Health Canada or other interested analysts to measure exactly the impact of the change. As Health Canada wants to be able to monitor the consequences of legislative changes and anti-smoking policies on smoking behaviour, the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey was designed to provide Health Canada and its partners/stakeholders with continual and reliable data on tobacco use and related issues.</p><br><br>Since 1999, two CTUMS files have been released every year: a file with data collected from February to June and a file with the July to December data. Additionally, there is also a yearly summary. <br><br>The survey is presented in three cycles: Cycle 1 - taken Feb-June 2002; Cycle 2 - taken July-Dec 2002; and Cycle Annual - combining both time periods. Each cycle contains two files; household data, and person data.<br><br>The primary objective of the survey is to provide a continuous supply of smoking prevalence data against which changes in prevalence can be monitored. This objective differs from that of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) which collects smoking data from a longitudinal sample to measure which individuals are changing their smoking behaviour, the possible factors which contribute to change, and the possible risk factors related to starting smoking and smoking duration. Because the NPHS collects data every two years and releases the data about a year after completing the collection cycle, it does not meet Health Canada’s need for continuous coverage in time, rapid delivery of data, or sufficient detail of the most at-risk populations, namely 15-24 year olds.<br><br>The Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey allows Health Canada to look at smoking prevalence by province-sex-age group, for age groups 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44 and 45+ on a semi-annual basis.

"(Restricted) Producer Price Index (PPI)",2005,United States. Bureau of Labor Statistics,"The Producer Price Index is a monthly survey that measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. Price change is measured from the perspective of the seller. About 10,000 PPIs for individual products and groups of products are released each month.The PPI universe consists of the output of all industries in the goods-producing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as the output of the natural gas, electricity, and construction industries. Recycled goods that compete with those made in the goods-producing sectors, such as waste and scrap materials, also are outputs that are part of the survey. Imports are not included within the PPI universe; however, goods shipped between establishments owned by the same company (termed interplant or intracompany transfers) are included, as is a substantial percentage of the domestic production of goods specifically made for the military. The output of the services sector and other sectors that do not produce physical products also is conceptually within the PPI universe.The PPI program covers approximately 72 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by revenue reported in the 2012 Economic Census, and collects data for selected industries in the following sectors: wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance and insurance; real estate brokering, rental, and leasing; professional, scientific, and technical services; administrative, support, and waste management services; health care and social assistance; and accommodation.There are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company survey respondents:-Industry classification. A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices received for the industry's output sold outside the industry (that is, its net output). -Commodity classification. The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. -Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have undergone. <b>An overview of the survey can be found in the BLS Handbook of Methods at:  https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/ppi-20111028.pdf </b>","United States.

The panel component of the study design provides anopportunity to trace how the changing fortunes of the Bush presidency,from the high levels of approval at the start of the Gulf War throughthe decline after the onset of a recession, affected voting in theNovember 1992 presidential election. It also permits analysts toinvestigate the origins of the Clinton and Perot coalitions as well aschanges in the public's political preferences over the two yearspreceding the 1992 election. In the 1990 Post-Election Survey twoforms of the survey instrument were used, with about 75 percent of thecontent being the same on both forms. Survey questions included thenow-standard National Election Studies battery of questions, alongwith items on presidential performance and the Persian Gulfconflict. Additionally, Form A contained questions relating to valuesand individualism, while Form B had content relating to foreignrelations. In 1991, respondents were reinterviewed several monthsafter hostilities in the Persian Gulf ended, and in this second wavethe survey content consisted of a repeat of a subset of questions fromthe 1990 Post-Election Survey, along with additional items especiallyrelevant to the Gulf War. A number of contextual variables also areprovided, including summary variables that combine the respondent'srecall of his or her senator's and representative's vote on the use offorce with that congressperson's actual vote. The content for the 1992Election Study reflects its dual purpose, both as the traditionalpresidential election year time-series data collection and as thethird wave of a panel study.

"ABC News/Washington Post Clarence Thomas Hearing Poll, September 1991",1991,The Washington Post,"The nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court was  the central focus of this survey. Respondents were asked if they  approved or disapproved of the nomination, whether the Senate should  confirm Thomas's nomination, whether the Supreme Court was too  conservative or too liberal in its decisions, and whether the  presence of Thomas on the court would make the court more  conservative or liberal. Respondents were also queried regarding  their awareness of the Senate hearings on Thomas's nomination, if  Thomas was one of the best available people for the job, and whether  the Senate should consider Thomas's political views as well as his  background and qualifications. Further questions included whether the  respondent agreed or disagreed with Thomas's opposition to programs  that gave minorities preference in jobs and education to make up for  past inequalities, whether Thomas understood the concerns of most  Black Americans, whether the respondent favored or opposed the 1973  ruling to legalize abortion and if Thomas should be confirmed on the  basis of his support or opposition to legalized abortion, whether  Thomas should have discussed his views on abortion laws at the  confirmation hearings, and whether the opposition to the Thomas  nomination by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored  People (NAACP) and National Organization for Women (NOW) influenced  the respondent's support for Thomas.

"Transnational Relations and Regional Regulation in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, 1975",1975,"Mytelka, Lynn K.","This data collection contains survey data gathered from 90chemical and metalworking (light engineering) industries in Ecuador,Peru, and Colombia in 1975, five years after the Andean Group (aregional subgroup of the Latin American Free Trade Association)instituted Decision 24, a policy that regulated foreign investment inmember countries. The three countries with firms represented in thestudy were national political economies characterized by differentdegrees of industrialization and hence different configurations ofsociopolitical forces. They were also relatively politically stableduring the five-year period before the survey, thereby implying agreater measure of continuity in the application of Decision 24 thanwas observed in the other Andean Group countries of Chile and Bolivia,or Venezuela, which did not join the Andean Group until 1973. Also,because of the application of Law 444 in Colombia and the General Lawof Industries and ITINTEC in Peru, it was anticipated that managers inthose two countries would be more conscious of the range of choiceavailable in the selection of technology and that firms would haverecently begun to increase the level of in-house R&amp;D activities. Thechemical and metalworking industries fell within the ambit of Andeanindustrial programming activities, so managers in those industrieswere expected to represent a group of relatively well-informed personswith respect to Andean Group issues. The data were obtained from anorally administered, primarily open-ended questionnaire given tomanagers of the selected firms. The survey's data measure: (1) thesize of the firm in terms of assets, earnings, employment, and sales,(2) the ownership structure of the firm and changes over time, (3)self-evaluation of future market position and development plans, (4)source of technology, including explanation of the choice, cost oftechnology (royalties), and date for all licenses, (5) R&amp;D activitiesand expenditures of the firm, (6) firm's relationship to theintegrative system (imports from and exports to other Andean countriesand the world), and (7) attitudes of firm managers toward Decision 24and toward attempts by government to regulate Direct ForeignInvestment (DFI) and Technology Transfer.","Mytelka, Lynn K.

"Labour Force Survey, May 2003 [Canada] [Rebased]",2003,Labour Statistics Division,"<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p><p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p><p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The ""Sysmiss"" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the ""Valid"" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p><p>LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

"Labour Force Survey, February 2005 [Canada] [Rebased]",2005,Labour Statistics Division,"<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p><p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p><p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The ""Sysmiss"" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the ""Valid"" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p><p>LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

"(Restricted) Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employer Characteristics File (ECF) Title 26 Components",1985,United States. Bureau of the Census,"The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) program produces new, cost effective, public-use information combining federal, state and Census Bureau data on employers and employees under the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership. State and local authorities increasingly need detailed local information about their economies to make informed decisions. The LED Partnership works to fill critical data gaps and provide indicators needed by state and local authorities. Under the LED Partnership, states agree to share unemployment insurance earnings data and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data with the Census Bureau. The LEHD program combines these administrative data, additional administrative data, and data from censuses and surveys. From these data, the program creates statistics on employment, earnings, and job flows at detailed levels of geography and industry and for different demographic groups. In addition, the LEHD program uses these data to create partially synthetic data on workers' residential patterns.The Employer Characteristics File (ECF) consolidates LEHD employer microdata information on size, location, industry, etc., into two easily accessible files. For each firm identified by SEIN, establishment-level data, identified by SEIN-SEINUNIT, is stored in the ""SEINUNIT file."" Some information is aggregated to the SEIN level, and stored in the ""SEIN file."" The SEIN file contains no new information, and should be viewed merely as an easier and/or more efficient way of accessing data aggregated to the firm level. Each file contains one record for every YEAR QUARTER a firm and/or establishment is present in either the ES-202 or the UI. All information is subject to extensive data edits and imputation, and the final files contain no missing information. For a more extensive description of data processing in the ECF, we refer the reader to Vilhuber and McKinney (2014). The files can be linked to other Census data through the use of the LEHD SEIN as well as the EIN.This dataset contains firm EIN, firm size, firm age, and firm ID which have been sourced from Federal Tax Information. As a result, they have been removed from the core ECF and stored separately.

"Labour Force Historical Review, 2010 [Canada] [B2020]",2010,Statistics Canada,"<p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household survey carried out monthly by Statistics Canada. Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.</p><p>Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:<br /><ol><li> The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.</li><li>There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors for this period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.</li><li>The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour market trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.</li></ol></p><p>The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.</p><p>For current LFS data refer to <a href=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/surveys/3701"" target=""_blank"">Statistics Canada</a></p><p><a href=""http://odesi.scholarsportal.info/documentation/LFHR/2010/data-donnees-eng.html"" target=""_blank"">Access data here</a></p>","Statistics Canada.

"The Viral Hepatitis Northern Network: A Platform for Addressing Viral Hepatitis in the Canadian North",2007,R.P. Bryce Larke,"An internet-based software program on Viral Hepatitis care in the North was developed, implemented, distributed, and is being regularly updated. The program allows healthcare providers to learn about HBV and diagnose/manage infected persons more effectively. The various forms of hepatitis B can be divided into more aggressive forms (subtypes B2-5) that frequently result in cirrhosis/liver cancer and more ""benign"" forms (subtypes B1 or B6) that rarely do so. Team members analyzed samples from Northern Canadians known to be infected with hepatitis B in the early 1980s. Representative sera from the 1983-85 serum bank were identified and transferred to the investigator's laboratory for testing for occult hepatitis B virus infection. The results revealed that the majority of Northern Canadians are infected with the more ""benign"" B6 subtype. Moreover, the amount of virus present in the circulation was relatively low, another predictor of a good outcome. The study also determined what percent of Northern Canadians are infected despite testing negative by standard diagnostic tests. Finally, the virus itself was analyzed to determine why in some instances it does not cause problems while in others, cirrhosis or liver cancer develop. The latter project was performed in conjunction with researchers from the United States and Denmark. Because HBV-induced rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer are higher in Alaska and Greenland than Northern Canada, collaborations were secured with investigators from these regions who submitted samples from infected individuals. The samples were used for genotyping, sequencing and identifying which HBV mutations are associated with adverse versus benign outcomes.","Gerald Y.

"Changing the Rules: State Mortgage Foreclosure Moratoria During the Great Depression",2009,"Wheelock, David C.","Many U.S. states imposed temporary moratoria on farm and nonfarm residential mortgage foreclosures during the Great Depression. This article describes the conditions that led some states to impose these moratoria and other mortgage relief during the Depression and discusses the economic effects. Moratoria were more common in states with large farm populations (as a percentage of totalstate population) and high farm mortgage foreclosure rates, although nonfarm mortgage distress appears to help explain why a few states with relatively low farm foreclosure rates also imposed moratoria. The moratoria reduced farm foreclosure rates in the short run, but they also appear to have reduced the supply of loans and made credit more expensive for subsequent borrowers. Theevidence from the Great Depression demonstrates how government actions to reduce foreclosures can impose costs that should be weighed against potential benefits.","Wheelock, David C.

"CBS News Special Recruitment Poll, January 1992  ",1993,CBS News,"In this poll, respondents were asked to give their approval  ratings of George Bush with respect to his handling of the presidency,  foreign policy, and the economy, to indicate the amount of attention  they had paid to the 1992 presidential campaign, and to reveal their  vote intentions for the 1992 presidential election. Those surveyed  fielded questions concerning the likelihood of voting for Bush, the  condition of the national economy, and whether they were currently  better off than they were four years ago. In addition, respondents were  asked to identify how money saved from defense spending should be used,  to comment on the most important problem the United States government  should spend tax dollars on, and to indicate their willingness to pay  more in taxes so that the government could increase spending on items  such as health care, education, and homelessness. Respondents were also  recruited to participate in an experimental survey on January 28 to  assess immediate viewer reaction to President Bush's State of the Union  address during a CBS News special following the speech. Those recruited  for this survey were asked to call back after the president's message  and give their approval rating of Bush. They were also asked whether  Bush's proposed tax cut would help end the recession, whether the  speech influenced their confidence in Bush's ability to improve the  economy, whether they were better off than four years ago, whether they  were worried about losing their jobs, and whether they would be willing  to pay more taxes if the federal government paid everybody's health  care costs. Additional questions concerned Bush's understanding of the  problems of the middle class, Clinton's explanation about his personal  life, the media's exaggeration of poor economic conditions, where to  place the blame for the United States' economic problems, paying more  taxes to improve education, and the future for the next generation of  Americans. Background information on respondents includes sex, age,  race, education, family income, political orientation, party  preference, voter registration status, most recent presidential vote  choice, employment status, labor union membership, health insurance status, and socioeconomic self-placement.","CBS News.

"Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling",2018,"Pavlidis, Paul","Background:Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in an array of morphological, behavioural and neurobiological deficits that can range in their severity. Despite extensive research in the field and a significant progress made, especially in understanding the range of possible malformations and neurobehavioral abnormalities, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol responses in development are still not well understood. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies looking at the changes in gene expression after PAE in animal models, however there is a limited apparent consensus among the reported findings. In an effort to address this issue, we performed a comprehensive re-analysis and meta-analysis of all suitable, publically available expression data sets.Methods:We assembled ten microarray data sets of gene expression after PAE in mouse and rat models consisting of samples from a total of 63 ethanol-exposed and 80 control animals. We re-analyzed each data set for differential expression and then used the results to perform meta-analyses considering all data sets together or grouping them by time or duration of exposure (pre- and post-natal, acute and chronic, respectively). We performed network and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to further characterize the identified signatures.Results:For each sub-analysis we identified signatures of differential expressed genes that show support from multiple studies. Overall, the changes in gene expression were more extensive after acute ethanol treatment during prenatal development than in other models. Considering the analysis of all the data together, we identified a robust core signature of 104 genes down-regulated after PAE, with no up-regulated genes. Functional analysis reveals over-representation of genes involved in protein synthesis, mRNA splicing and chromatin organization.Conclusions:Our meta-analysis shows that existing studies, despite superficial dissimilarity in findings, share features that allow us to identify a common core signature set of transcriptome changes in PAE. This is an important step to identifying the biological processes that underlie the etiology of FASD.","Rogic S, Wong A, Pavlidis P.

Bureau of the Census,"Public Law 94-171, enacted in 1975, requires the Census  Bureau to provide redistricting data in a format requested by state  governments. Within one year following the Decennial Census (by April  1, 1991), the Census Bureau must provide the governor and legislature  of each state with the population data needed to redraw legislative  districts. To meet this requirement, the Census Bureau established a  voluntary program to allow states to receive data for voting districts  (e.g., election precincts, city wards) in addition to standard census  geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and blocks.  These files contain data for voting districts for those counties for  which a state outlined voting district boundaries around a set of  census blocks on census maps, in accordance with the guidelines of the  program. Each state file provides data for the state and its subareas  in the following order: state, county, voting district, county  subdivision, place, census tract, block group, and block. Additionally,  complete summaries are provided for the following geographic areas:  county subdivision, place, consolidated city, state portion of American  Indian and Alaska Native area, and county portion of American Indian  and Alaska Native area.

The water level in the pipe or riser casing reaches, after some rest time, a static position or elevation, z2.  Then, the water level position is changed rapidly, by adding or removing some water volume, or by inserting or removing a solid slug.  Afterward, the water level position or elevation z1(t) is recorded vs. time t, yielding a difference in hydraulic head or water column defined as Z(t) = z1(t) - z2.  The water level at rest is assumed to be the piezometric level or PL for the tested zone, before drilling a hole and installing test equipment.  All equations use Z(t) or Z*(t) = Z(t) / Z(t=0).  The water-level response vs. time may be a slow return to equilibrium (overdamped test), or an oscillation back to equilibrium (underdamped test).  This document deals exclusively with overdamped tests.  Their data may be analyzed using several methods, known to yield different results for the hydraulic conductivity.  The methods fit in three groups: group 1 neglects the influence of the solid matrix strain, group 2 is for tests in aquitards with delayed strain caused by consolidation, and group 3 takes into account some elastic and instant solid matrix strain.  This document briefly explains what is wrong with certain theories and why.  It shows three ways to plot the data, which are the three diagnostic graphs.  According to experience with thousands of tests, most test data are biased by an incorrect estimate z2 of the piezometric level at rest.  The derivative or velocity plot does not depend upon this assumed piezometric level, but can verify its correctness.  The document presents experimental results and explains the three-diagnostic graphs approach, which unifies the theories and, most important, yields a user-independent result.  Two free spreadsheet files are provided. The spreadsheet ""Lefranc-Test-English-Model"" follows the Canadian standards and is used to explain how to treat correctly the test data to reach a user-independent result.  The user does not modify this model spreadsheet but can make as many copies as needed, with different names.  The user can treat any other data set in a copy, and can also modify any copy if needed.  The second Excel spreadsheet contains several sets of data that can be used to practice with the copies of the model spreadsheet.</p><p>En génie civil et géologique, on a utilisé depuis plus d'un siècle les essais in situ de perméabilité à niveau variable (essais VH ou slug tests), afin d'évaluer la conductivité hydraulique locale des sols et rocs testés. Le niveau d'eau dans le tuyau ou le tubage prend, après une période de repos, une position ou élévation statique, z2. Ensuite, on modifie rapidement la position du niveau d'eau, en ajoutant ou en enlevant rapi-dement un volume d'eau, ou en insérant ou retirant un objet solide.  La position ou l'élévation du niveau d'eau, z1(t), est alors notée en fonction du temps, t, ce qui donne une différence de charge hydraulique définie par Z(t) = z1(t) - z2. Le niveau d'eau au repos est supposé être le niveau piézométrique pour la zone testée, avant de forer un trou et d'installer l'équipement pour un essai. Toutes les équations utilisent Z(t) ou Z*(t) = Z(t) / Z(t=0). La réponse du niveau d'eau avec le temps peut être soit un lent retour à l'équilibre (cas suramorti) soit une oscillation amortie retournant à l'équilibre (cas sous-amorti). Ce document ne traite que des cas suramortis. Leurs données peuvent être analysées à l'aide de plusieurs méthodes, connues pour donner des résultats différents pour la conductivité hydraulique. Les méthodes appartiennent à trois groupes : le groupe 1 néglige l'influence de la déformation de la matrice solide, le groupe 2 est pour les essais dans des aquitards avec une déformation différée causée par la consolidation, et le groupe 3 prend en compte une certaine déformation élastique et instantanée de la matrice solide. Ce document explique brièvement ce qui est incorrect dans les théories et pourquoi.  Il montre trois façons de tracer les données, qui sont les trois graphiques de diagnostic.  Selon l'expérience de milliers d'essais, la plupart des données sont biaisées par un estimé incorrect de z2, le niveau piézométrique supposé.  Le graphe de la dérivée ou graphe des vitesses ne dépend pas de la valeur supposée pour le niveau piézomé-trique, mais peut vérifier son exactitude.  Le document présente des résultats expérimentaux et explique le diagnostic à trois graphiques, qui unifie les théories et donne un résultat indépendant de l'utilisateur, ce qui est important.

"Casino Gaming and Local Employment Trends",2004,"Garrett, Thomas A.","Casino gambling has become a major industry in the United States. Economic development, especially through increases in employment, is the primary justification for casino development in a local area. This article estimates the employment effects of casino gambling for six counties in the Midwest and southern United States using ARIMA forecasting models. The results suggest that rural counties that adopt casino gambling as a major industry experience significant gains in payroll and household employment. The effects are less pronounced in urban counties, partly due to the higher volatilityof their employment data relative to those rural counties.","Garrett, Thomas A.

"Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling",9999,"Pavlidis, Paul","<p>Background:<br>Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in an array of morphological, behavioural and neurobiological deficits that can range in their severity. Despite extensive research in the field and a significant progress made, especially in understanding the range of possible malformations and neurobehavioral abnormalities, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol responses in development are still not well understood. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies looking at the changes in gene expression after PAE in animal models, however there is a limited apparent consensus among the reported findings. In an effort to address this issue, we performed a comprehensive re-analysis and meta-analysis of all suitable, publically available expression data sets.<p><p>Methods:<br>We assembled ten microarray data sets of gene expression after PAE in mouse and rat models consisting of samples from a total of 63 ethanol-exposed and 80 control animals. We re-analyzed each data set for differential expression and then used the results to perform meta-analyses considering all data sets together or grouping them by time or duration of exposure (pre- and post-natal, acute and chronic, respectively). We performed network and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to further characterize the identified signatures.<p><p>Results:<br>For each sub-analysis we identified signatures of differential expressed genes that show support from multiple studies. Overall, the changes in gene expression were more extensive after acute ethanol treatment during prenatal development than in other models. Considering the analysis of all the data together, we identified a robust core signature of 104 genes down-regulated after PAE, with no up-regulated genes. Functional analysis reveals over-representation of genes involved in protein synthesis, mRNA splicing and chromatin organization.<p><p>Conclusions:<br>Our meta-analysis shows that existing studies, despite superficial dissimilarity in findings, share features that allow us to identify a common core signature set of transcriptome changes in PAE. This is an important step to identifying the biological processes that underlie the etiology of FASD.<p>","Rogic, Sanja; Wong, Albertina; Pavlidis, Paul, 2019, ""Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling"", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/QAEXQR, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1",medicine health and life sciences; metaanalysis; gene expression; fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; prenatal alcohol exposure,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dataverse_sp/doi--10-5683_SP2_QAEXQR.xml

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada.

"Aggregate Dynamics of Campaigns",2009,"Farrell, Christian A.","Daily interactions between partisan elites, the media, and citizens are the driving dynamic of election campaigns and the central determinant of their outcomes. Accordingly, we develop a theory of campaign dynamics thatdeparts from previous top-down models of campaign effects in its emphasis on the reciprocal campaign interactions between these actors. We examine these interactions with daily data on campaign expenditures, media coverage,and voter support in the 2000 presidential campaign. We find that partisan elites, the media, and citizens each played critical and interdependent roles in creating the dynamics of the campaign and producing the closest electionin decades.

Hate crimedata collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990and to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, theViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate CrimeStatistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, asfactors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although theAct originally mandated data collection for five years, the ChurchArson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration ""for eachcalendar year,"" making hate crime statistics a permanent addition tothe UCR program.

"National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), 1994-2008: Contextual Data [Restricted Use]",1994,"Udry, J. Richard","The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States during the 1994-1995 school year. TheAdd Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents' social, economic, psychological, and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood. The files contained in this component of the Add Health restricted data are Waves I-III Contextual Files Data, Waves I-II Neighborhood Data, Wave I Spatial Analysis Data, Waves III-IV Grouping File Data, and Waves III-IV Census Region data. The contextual files data contain community contextual variables based on state, county, tract, and block group levels derived from Waves I, II, and III addresses. The neighborhood data and grouping file data contain pseudo state, county, tract, and block group variables that allow grouping Add Health respondents geographically. Wave I Spatial Analysis Data include X, Y coordinates that can be used to calculate distances between friends in a school community.

Economic Behavior Program,"This survey was undertaken to measure changes in consumer attitudes and expectations, to understand why such changes occur, and to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, borrow, or make discretionary purchases. This type of information is essential for forecasting changes in aggregate consumer behavior. Since the 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and monthly thereafter. Each monthly survey probes a different aspect of consumer confidence. Open-ended questions are asked concerning evaluations and expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Additional questions inquired about buying intentions for automobiles and computers, and the respondents' appraisals of present market conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, computers, and other durables. Also explored in this survey were respondents' types of savings and financial investments, loan and credit card use, family income, and sources of income. Other questions focused on respondents' use of personal computers at home and in the office, and respondents' ownership, lease, and use of automobiles.

The collection provides two datasets for each year since 1976 that are accessible only through the ICPSR Virtual Data Enclave VDE) and include original variables, including the unaltered weight variable, that in the public-use data were  altered or omitted: one dataset without State, County, and Zip Code and one dataset including State, County, and Zip Code. Use of the geographic identifiers such as state, county, or zip code is limited and researchers interested in these variables are encouraged to read FAQs: About MTF Restricted-Use Geographic and Other Variables. Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate).

The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.</p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced.</p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Employment and Social Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.</p><p> Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The ""Sysmiss"" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the ""Valid"" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values.</p><p> LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996.</p>","Statistics Canada. 2016. Labour Force Survey, August [public-use microdata file].

"Employment Insurance Coverage Survey, 2004",2004,Statistics Canada,"The main purpose of this survey is to study the coverage of the employment insurance program. It provides a meaningful picture of who does or does not have access to EI benefits among the jobless and those in a situation of underemployment. The Employment Insurance Coverage Survey also covers access to maternity and parental benefits.The survey was designed to produce a series of precise measures to identify groups with low probability of receiving benefits, for instance, the long-term jobless, labour market entrants and students, people becoming unemployed after uninsured employment, people who have left jobs voluntarily and individuals who are eligible, given their employment history, but do not claim or otherwise receive benefits. The survey provides a detailed description of the characteristics of the last job held as well as reasons for not receiving benefits or for not claiming.Through the survey data, analysts will also be able to observe the characteristics and situation of people not covered by EI and of those who exhausted EI benefits, the job search intensity of the unemployed, expectation of recall to a job, and alternate sources of income and funds.Survey data pertaining to maternity and parental benefits answer questions on the proportion of mothers of an infant who received maternity and parental benefits, the reason why some mothers do not receive benefits and about sharing parental benefits with their spouse. The survey also allows looking at the timing and circumstances related to the return to work, the income adequacy of households with young children and more.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dlimf/ca-statcan-21805.xml

Dynamic factor methods can be used to incorporate a wide range of economic information when forecasting or measuring economic shocks. This article introduces dynamic factor models that underlie the data-rich methods and also tests whether the data-rich models can help a benchmark autoregressive model forecast alternative measures of inflation and real economic activity at horizons of 3, 12, and 24 months ahead. The authors find that, over the past decade, the data-rich models significantly improve the forecasts for a variety of real output and inflation indicators. For all the series that they examine, the authors find that the data-rich models become more useful when forecasting over longer horizons. The exception is the unemployment rate, where the principal components provide significant forecasting information at all horizons.","Gavin, William T., and Kevin L. Kliesen.

"Six Cities Trusteeship Project: Trustee Biographical Dataset, 1931, 1961, 1991 [Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Philadelphia]",1931,"Beaudin, Christy L.","For this study, researchers examined the composition of 15 types of not-for-profit boards of trustees: secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, Junior League, community foundation, institution of higher education, secular family service, Catholic family service, Jewish family service, YMCA, and YWCA, and focused on three separate time periods: 1931, 1961, and 1991. Trustee lists were either obtained from the organization itself, annual reports, or the IRS 990 forms. Once the trustee lists were acquired, the study team in each city began background research on the trustees in order to provide answers on the trustee code sheets. The project coordinator provided research teams in each city with codesheets indicating the information to be collected. Memoranda were sent to researchers with instructions as questions arose or coding procedures changed. The research teams collected biographical information on trustees through print sources, Nexis searches, and interviews. They completed the codesheets as thoroughly as possible given the information available. There is extensive missing data in this study due to factors such as a lack of adequate records from 1931 and uncooperative organizations. The trustee biographical study collected data on 8,927 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods). The data set archived at CPANDA was missing data for 22 entire boards.Researchers collected biographical information on trustees through the use of local, public, university, and foundation libraries; personal interviews; historical societies; archives; and other depositories of historical data.","Abzug, Rikki, Paul DiMaggio, Bradford Gray, Peter Dobkin Hall, Michael Useem, Chul Hee Kang, Joseph Galaskiewicz, Elizabeth Turner Sosin, Ann Deetz, David Hammack, Diane Grabowski, Yuan Li, Todd Michney, David Swartz, Lisa Buxbaum, Richard Roth, Judith R.

"Aboriginal Peoples Survey, 2001 [Canada]: Adults off reserve",2001,Statistics Canada. Social and Aboriginal Statistics Division,"The 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) was conducted by Statistics Canada to collect data on the lifestyles and living conditions of Aboriginal people in Canada. The survey was designed and implemented in partnership with national Aboriginal organizations.<br/><br/>This is the second time the Aboriginal Peoples Survey has been carried out by Statistics Canada; the first time was in the fall of 1991. The data from the 1991 APS were widely used. An extremely important user of the 1991 data was the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). They used the data as a primary source of demographic, social and economic data for their final report and related research studies. The Commission's final report recommended that APS be conducted regularly to monitor the demographic and social conditions of Aboriginal peoples.<br/><br/>The federal government responded to the RCAP recommendations through its Aboriginal action plan, Gathering Strength. In this plan the need for relevant and current data was recognized under the umbrella of developing a new fiscal relationship. Statistics Canada was mandated through Gathering Strength to coordinate a second Aboriginal Peoples Survey shortly after the 2001 Census.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the 2001 APS was to provide data on the social and economic conditions of Aboriginal people in Canada. More specifically, its purpose was to identify the needs of Aboriginal people and focus on issues such as health, language, employment, income, schooling, housing, and mobility. Indeed, there are large gaps in the data that presently exist for Aboriginal people. The 2001 APS was designed to address some of these gaps. This is information that cannot be found anywhere else and it can be used to answer a wide range of questions related to things like community planning, program development and health care priorities. Over 122,000 people were targeted for the 2001 survey and information on a broad range of topics is available.<br/><br/>The PUMF should be used together with the data dictionary, which includes the survey questions, derived variables, and frequency distributions of all the variables.

The collection provides two datasets for each year since 1976 that are accessible only through the ICPSR Virtual Data Enclave VDE) and include original variables, including the unaltered weight variable, that in the public-use data were  altered or omitted: one dataset without State, County, and Zip Code and one dataset including State, County, and Zip Code. Use of the geographic identifiers such as state, county, or zip code is limited and researchers interested in these variables are encouraged to read FAQs: About MTF Restricted-Use Geographic and Other Variables. Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate).

This project's main purpose was to develop a suite of instruments measuring K-8 teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT). These instruments are typically used to evaluate content-focused mathematics professional development. Over the years, this project piloted these measures in several contexts to establish psychometric properties of the instruments:With a nationally representative sample of middle school mathematics teachers in 2005 and again in 2006. The same sample was surveyed at both time points. With a nationally representative sample of elementary school teachers in 2008. With smaller samples of grade 4-8 teachers on specific mathematical topics (e.g., a form on rational number, a form on proportional reasoning). The specific research questions varied with the sample. For the later pilots, we were interested in the psychometric properties of the measures and teacher scores' relationship to other teacher characteristics, such as their mathematical background and years of experience.","Hill, Heather, Deborah Loewenberg Ball, Hyman Bass, Geoffrey Phelps, and Merrie Blunk.

Data is presented here for seaweed cover (%), understory cover (%) and invertebrate density for two sites on Wizard Islet. The third site located at the mouth of Grappler Inlet is discussed in the study report.<p/>Wizard Islet (48°51’29.5”N, 125°09’31”W) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).<p/>At both sites, a line of numbered tags spaced at 1m intervals at the same tidal height was installed. The tags denote the upper origin for 50 vertical transects. Fifteen tag numbers were chosen randomly, and transects were extended from the tags to the water. At the sheltered site, the tag numbers were 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 28, 35, 36, 40, 42, 48, 49. At the exposed site, they were 4, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 23, 26, 31, 32, 36, 42, 44, 45, 49.<p/>Sampling was done at tidal heights 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5m. To maintain consistency, all quadrats were positioned to the left and above each point on the transect (when facing away from the water).<p/>Algal canopy cover (%) which includes seaweeds and one grass was estimated using a 25x25cm quadrat divided into 100 squares or 1%. A square was counted if it contained &gt;=50% canopy cover. If a species was present but &lt;50%, abundance was recorded as 0.5%.<p/>Understory species cover (%) which includes algal species, encrusting invertebrates and rocks was estimated using the point intercept method for 20 random points in a 25x25cm quadrat of 100 squares. Since 20 of 100 possible intersections were marked, each point represented 5%. Each point could contain multiple organisms (layers), e.g. Balanus growing on Mytilus.<p/>Invertebrates were counted if &gt;=50% of the organism occurred within the quadrat. Quadrat size depended on the density of the organism (e.g. 12.5x12.5cm for Littorina, 25x25cm for Hemigrapsus, 50x50cm for Pisaster).<p/>Data was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Tom Berman with Teaching Assistant Russ Markel July 21-Aug 29, 1997.","Cowan, Janet E.; Herman, Tom; Leonard, Karen; Markel, Russ; Oliver, Kathryn; Repard, Dora; Shapiro, Judith; Shubs, Shana, 2019, ""Replication data for: Barkley Sound intertidal long-term monitoring: rocky substrate methodology"", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/PGCBPL, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:zFDD4TFTLQDi3N4mrQzTUA== [fileUNF]",earth and environmental sciences; invertebrates; seaweeds; long term monitoring; barkley sound; wizard islet; rocky intertidal habitat; wave exposure; tidal height,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dataverse_sp/doi--10-5683_SP2_PGCBPL.xml

Data were collected from multiple informants at seven major time points: age 5 (1977), age 6 (1978), age 9 (1980-1981), age 15 (1987), age 18 (1990), age 21 (1993-1994), and age 26 (1998). Since its inception in 1977, the SLS has utilized a multidisciplinary, multimethod approach, with the dual goals of: (1) tracing the development and course of academic difficulties, behavior problems, and psychopathology; and (2) identifying factors that promote health functioning from early childhood (age 5) to adulthood (age 26). The SLS has consistently emphasized the identification of modifiable social and environmental risk and protective factors that can be targeted directly in prevention and intervention programs. To date, SLS has published 50 journal articles and 9 book chapters. The original study group was comprised of every child who entered kindergarten in the fall of 1977 in one public school district in a northeastern town in the United States. For this wave of the study, Wave 5, researchers revisited with study participants in 1990 when they were 18 years old and most were seniors in high school thinking about future plans for work and education.

Respondents who commuted in the greater Washington, DC, area were asked about traffic conditions in the region, their primary means of transportation to and from work, the length of their commute, what they liked and disliked most about their commute, and whether they had ever relocated or adjusted their work schedule to improve their commute. Those polled rated the different types of public transportation available in the area, how often they used the Metrorail subway system, and why they did not ride it more often. Views were sought on proposals to expand the Metrorail system and build new highways in the area, sources of funding for transportation projects, and whether measures such as high occupancy vehicle lanes, adjustable tolls, and building new roads were effective in easing traffic congestion. Respondents were also asked about the type of vehicle they drove, how often they traveled by car, how much time they spent driving, and how often driving invoked feelings such as independence, relaxation, and anger. A series of questions asked respondents how often they and others were guilty of behaviors such as speeding or road rage, and whether they engaged in activities such as eating or reading while driving. Additional topics addressed the use of automatic cameras at traffic lights and stop signs and whether existing traffic laws were too tough on teenage drivers.

"Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: National Incident-Based Reporting System, [United States], 2016",2016,United States. Federal Bureau of Investigation,"NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system which means data are collectedon each single crime occurrence.  NIBRS data are designed to be generatedas a by-product of local, State, and Federal automated records managementsystems. Thus, an agency can build its own system to suit its individualneeds, including all the information required for administrative andoperational purposes. Only the data required by NIBRS are then reported tothe national UCR Program.NIBRS collects data on each single incident and arrest within 22 offensecategories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. For each of the offenses coming to the attention of lawenforcement, various facts about the crime are collected. In addition tothe Group A offenses, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported.Central to NIBRS is the concept of a crime incident. An incident is definedfor NIBRS reporting purposes as one or more offenses committed by the sameoffender, or group of offenders acting in concert, at the same time andplace. ""Acting in concert"" requires that the offenders actually commit orassist in the commission of the crime(s). The offenders must be aware of,and consent to, the commission of the crime(s); or even if nonconsenting,their actions assist in the commission of the offense(s). This is importantbecause all of the offenders in an incident are considered to havecommitted all of the offenses in the incident. If one or more of theoffenders did not act in concert, then there is more than one incidentinvolved.The phrase ""same time and place"" means that the time interval betweenthe offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurredwere insignificant. Normally, the offenses must have occurred during anunbroken period of time and at the same or adjoining location(s). However,incidents can also consist of offenses which by their nature involvecontinuing criminal activity by the same offender(s) at different times andplaces, as long as the activity is deemed to constitute a single criminaltransaction.","United States.

L'Examen des programmes, la restructuration de l'appareil gouvernemental, l'augmentation de la charge de travail et la rapidité des progrès technologiques ont eu de grandes répercussions sur les fonctionnaires fédéraux. Des études et des rapports récents sur certains segments de la fonction publique fédérale ont révélé que le découragement était répandu chez les cadres et les travailleurs intellectuels et que, de l'avis de nombreux employés, le milieu de travail ne les incitait pas à avoir confiance dans les gestionnaires, et ne favorisait pas la satisfaction et l'avancement professionnels. Il convenait de recueillir beaucoup plus d'information afin d'étudier plus à fond ces résultats et de déterminer si le cadre de travail pouvait être amélioré afin de relever les défis qui l'attendent à l'aube du nouveau millénaire.En 1997, le greffier du Conseil privé a proposé que l'on réalise un sondage facultatif auprès de tous les fonctionnaires fédéraux. Le Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor a été chargé de la mise en oeuvre du projet. Cet organisme a travaillé de concert avec d'autres ministères fédéraux de premier plan afin d'élaborer une enquête nationale qui recueillerait des données auprès de tous les fonctionnaires à l'aide du même questionnaire. Dans le cadre de ce projet, Statistique Canada a été invité à participer à l'élaboration de l'enquête et à procéder à la collecte et au traitement des données.Les résultats du sondage serviront de fondements aux mesures prises au sein du ministère ou de l'organisme, du secteur ou de la direction et, en dernière analyse, de l'unité de travail. De même, les résultats orienteront le programme de travail futur de la direction de l'organisme ou du ministère. Les résultats serviront de données de référence lorsque viendra le temps de mesurer les progrès réalisés au chapitre du renouvellement du milieu de travail.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dlimf/ca-statcan-3508-f.xml

"Portraits of Canada, 2005 [Canada]",2005,Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC),"<P> Portraits of Canada is an annual survey of public opinion in Canada conducted by the Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC). Its purpose is to track how the attitudes of Canadians have evolved on a range of issues relating to the nature and well-being of the federation, its institutions and its citizens. </P> <P> For eight years, the Canadian Unity Council's Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC) has conducted <i> Portraits of Canada </i>, an annual national survey of Canadians' opinions about government, each other and the country's future.<i> Portraits </i> is more than a poll; it is a vehicle to start a conversation with Canadians. We want to hear what they have to say - what you have to say - about what is going on and what the future holds. This in keeping with the CRIC's mandate to inform and to engage all Canadians in building and strengthening Canada. </P>  <P> In the 2005 edition of <i> Portraits </i>, we once again track how Canadians' attitudes have evolved on a range of issues relating to the nature and well-being of the country. Some of the questions that we have asked this year include:</P>  <P>- Do they consider a balanced budget as all that important? </P> <P>- How do they rate  their leaders?</P>  <P>- How do they feel about minority government?</P> <P>- Are they prepared to make trade-offs on civil liberties to ensure their security?</P> <P>Every year <i> Portraits </i> asks roughly 50 questions, a significant proportion of which have been asked in the past. This allows us to track which views are changing with time and which remain fairly constant. The sample size of oursurvey is large. Quite often the polls that you see in the news have about 1,000 respondents throughout Canada. By contrast, our sample of 3,201 Canadians is large enough to ensure that opinions in all regions of the country, including the three Northern Territories, are accurately reflected. Two separate surveys are carried out, one in Quebec (conducted by CROP) and one in the rest of Canada (conducted by Environics Research Group). The results are then combined. The survey's Quebec component was conducted September 13-26, 2005. As with any survey, there is a margin of error. In this case it is plus or minus 1.7%, 95% of the time.</P> <p>Once the information is analyzed and released at a major news conference, Council staff and supporters fan out across the country to present the results to groups ranging from young leaders, community groups, Rotary Clubs, high school, and university students to business associations, municipal, provincial, and federal officials, as well as politicians. This is where we start conversations with Canadians. </p>","Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC), 2015, ""Portraits of Canada, 2005 [Canada]"", hdl:10864/11084, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1",aboriginals; america; immigration; provinces; samesex marriage; taxes,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dataverse_sp/hdl--10864_11084.xml

"Labour Force Survey, November 2000 [Canada] [Rebased]",2000,Labour Statistics Division,"<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p><p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p><p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p><p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p><p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The ""Sysmiss"" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the ""Valid"" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p><p>LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

Thelegislation was in response to growing public concern regardingincidents of violence and vandalism occurring in the nation'sschools. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequencyand seriousness of crime in elementary and secondary schools in theUnited States, the number and location of schools affected by crime,the cost of replacement or repair of objects damaged by school crime,and possible methods of prevention. The legislation specified that thestudy was to be conducted by the National Institute of Education(NIE). The NIE designed the study in three phases, and data collectionwas carried out by the Research Triangle Institute, with computer worksupervised by Sheldon Laube of C.M. Leinwand Associates. The primarydata for the study were collected in two concurrent sample surveys:Phase I and Phase II. Phase I, a mail survey, asked more than 4,000elementary and secondary school principals to report in detail on theincidence of illegal or disruptive activities in their schools. Nineone-month reporting periods between February 1976 and January 1977,excluding summer months, were assigned to participating schools on arandom basis. Parts 2 and 11 contain data gathered from schoolprincipals in this phase. In Phase II, field representatives conductedon-site and follow-up surveys of junior and senior high schoolstudents and teachers in public secondary schools. They were asked toreport any experiences they might have had as victims of violence ortheft in the reporting month. In addition, they provided informationabout themselves, their schools, and their communities. Also, theprincipals in this sample were asked to keep a record of incidentsduring the reporting month, including robberies, attacks, andthefts. They also supplied information about their schools'characteristics and crime prevention methods. Parts 7, 16, 19, 24, 29,30, 35, 39, 43, and 47 contain the data gathered in this phase. Part18 contains the combined data gathered in the Principalquestionnaires, utilizing both Phase I and Phase II samples. Part 51is a file created to supply community information about each Phase IIschool. Most of its information was extracted from the 1970 Census,but it also includes weather and unemployment data. Phase III involveda more intensive qualitative study of 10 schools, most which had had ahistory of problems with crime and violence, but which had improveddramatically in a short time. Some crimes explored were vandalism,theft, personal violence, and verbal abuse. The place of occurrenceand characteristics of each offender were also examined.

General questions probed the respondents' usual level of satisfaction with the way they spent their weekends, whether they had too little or too much to do and wished they had done more or less, and whether they felt they had enough leisure time. Specifically, respondents were asked what activities they participated in, how many hours they spent watching television, how many hours they spent at their home computer, and whether they planned their activities in advance. Those surveyed were also asked about their source of information for things happening on the weekend, how often they went into Washington, DC itself, and if not very often, why. The survey also queried whether respondents had avoided attending any events after September 11, 2001, due to concerns over terrorist attacks. In addition, the survey contained questions about which candidate in the upcoming presidential election respondents were most likely to vote for.

"Applied Statistics Problem Sets for Instruction in Statistics in the Social Sciences",1984,"Iversen, Gudmund R.","This study contains a set of materials for the teaching of intermediate statistics, developed by the Consortium as part of its curricular development project. This project grew out of the ICPSR Training Program, and the underlying pedagogical perspectives matured in this program. ICPSR's experience strongly underscored the importance of moving the student of quantitative methods out of the passive mode and actively involving the student in the learning process. The materials in this study were created to present students with a sequence of intellectual tasks designed to facilitate their understanding of the logic and algorithms of various techniques. The data consist of two subsets, File 1, derived from the CIVIC CULTURE STUDY, 1959-1960 (ICPSR 7201) and File 2, extracted from the AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1968 (ICPSR 7281). The accompanying material consists of a book, APPLIED STATISTICS, by Gudmund R. Iversen, with two substantive examples by Helmut Norpoth and a chapter co-authored by Lawrence H. Boyd. Covered topics are regression analysis (simple and multiple, dummy variables, multicollinearity, analysis of residuals), analysis of variance and covariance, contingency tables, Bayesian statistics, and multilevel analysis. A revised manuscript exists in mimeographed form. The computer output and answers to the questions included in the book are also available.

"Consumer Expenditure Survey, 1988: Interview Survey, Detailed Expenditure Files",1988,United States Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics,"The ongoing Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) provides a  continuous flow of information on the buying habits of American  consumers and also furnishes data to support periodic revisions of the  Consumer Price Index. The survey consists of two separate components:  (1) a quarterly Interview Survey in which each consumer unit (CU) in  the sample is interviewed every three months over a 15-month period,  and (2) a Diary Survey completed by the sample CUs for two consecutive  one-week periods. The Interview Survey was designed to collect data on  major items of expense, household characteristics, and income. The  expenditures covered by the survey are those that respondents can  recall fairly accurately for three months or longer. In general, these  expenditures include relatively large purchases, such as those for  property, automobiles, and major appliances, or expenditures that occur  on a fairly regular basis, such as rent, utilities, or insurance  premiums. Expenditures incurred while on trips are also covered by the  survey. Excluded are nonprescription drugs, household supplies, and  personal care items. Including global estimates on spending for food,  it is estimated that about 90 to 95 percent of expenditures are covered  in the Interview Survey. The Detailed Expenditure (MTAB) files that  comprise this data collection were created from all the major  expenditure sections of the Interview Survey questionnaires. These  files contain more detailed expenditure records than those found in the  Interview Survey data.

It surveyed couples 15 months and 36 months after having applied to and been accepted into a Building Stronger Families (BSF) program at one of eight locations offering services to unwed couples expecting, or having recently had a baby. Major topics included family structure, parental involvement with children, relationships, personal and parental well-being, utilization of services such as workshops to help their relationship and parenting skills, paternity and child support, and family self-sufficiency. Respondents were asked for information on recently born children and relationship status, how much time they spent with their children, their level of satisfaction with their current relationship, substance use, if they had attended relationship and parental counseling, whether they were legally required to provide child support, employment, and family background. Additional information was asked about domestic violence and child abuse, legal trouble, past sexual history, and child development. The 36-month data collection effort also included direct assessments of parenting and child development. The quality of the parenting relationship was assessed for both mothers and fathers and was based on a semi-structured play activity, ""the two-bag task."" This interaction was videotaped and later coded by trained assessors on multiple dimensions of parenting. During assessments with mothers, the focal child's language development was also assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Demographic data includes race, education level, age, income, and marital status. The data collection is comprised of seven parts.

Thomas Juster, Paul Courant, et   al. This combined data collection consists of data from 620   respondents, their spouses if they were married at the time of first   contact, and up to three children between the ages of three and   seventeen living in the household. The key features which characterized   the 1975 time use study were repeated in 1981. In both of the data   collection years, adult individuals provided four time diaries as well   as extensive information related to their time use in the four waves of   data collection. Information pertaining to the household was collected,   as well as identical measures from respondents and spouses for all   person-specific information. Selected children provided two time diary   reports (one for a school day and one non-school day), an academic   achievement measure, and survey measures pertaining to school and   family life. In addition, teacher ratings were obtained. For each adult   individual who remained in the sample through the 1981 study, a time   budget was constructed from his or her time diaries containing the   number of minutes per week spent in each of some 223 mutually exclusive   and exhaustive activities. These measures provide a description of how   the sample individuals were currently allocating their time and are   comparable to the 87 activity measures created from their 1975 diaries.   In addition, respondent and spouse time aggregates were converted to   parent time aggregates for mothers and fathers of children in the   sample.

The BSF-R was replaced with an early reading and mathematics assessment similar to the assessments used in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) kindergarten and first grade collections. Unique to the preschool wave was the assessment of children's knowledge of basic colors. Fine motor skills were assessed by asking children to copy a series of forms/shapes drawn by assessors and to build structures using blocks. Gross motor skills were assessed by asking children to jump, balance on one foot, hop on one foot, skip, walk backward along a line, and catch a bean bag. Additionally, as in the previous waves, children's social interactions with the parent respondent were assessed using the Two Bags Task. All children had their height, weight, and middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measured, and children born with very low birth weight had their head circumference measured.",,child care; child development; child health; early childhood education,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/icpsr/28082.xml

"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), 2009",2009,United States Department of Health and Human Services. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality,"The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED) visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.The DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.","United States Department of Health and Human Services.

"Labour Force Survey, March 2010",2010,Statistics Canada,"The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dlimf/ca-statcan-66524.xml

It is the only national statistical collection that obtains detailed information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. The DCRP collects data on persons dying in state prisons, local jails and in the process of arrest. Each collection is a separate subcollection, but each is under the umbrella of the DCRP collection. The DCRP collects inmate death records from each of the nation's 50 state prison systems and approximately 2,800 local jail jurisdictions. In addition, this program collects records of all deaths occurring during the process of arrest. Data are collected directly from state and local law enforcement agencies.Death records include information on decedent personal characteristics (age, race or Hispanic origin, and sex), decedent criminal background (legal status, offense type, and time served), and the death itself (date, time, location, and cause of death, as well as information on the autopsy and medical treatment provided for any illness or disease).This data collection represents a single year of DCRP Jails data. The variable names and coding, while similar to other years, have not been standardized across years.

Withthe goal of remedying the previous lack of state-level data, thesurvey was conducted to aid in defining problems of insurance coverageand to analyze the impacts of states' policy options. The main unit ofobservation is the health insurance family, which includes the head,spouse, and their children up to age 18, or to age 23 if they were inschool. Variables on health insurance coverage include the types ofcoverage respondents carried (Medicare, Medicaid, additional state orfederal programs, and private policies), sources of private policycoverage, premiums paid for private policies, and number of monthsuninsured during the last year. Access to health care is measured byvariables such as the type of usual health care provider, the amountof time it usually took to get to the doctor's office, and whetherneeded medical care was not received during the previous year.Variables on the utilization of health care include the number ofovernight hospital stays, the number of visits to doctors, age atfirst DPT (diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus) shot, age at firstoral polio immunization, and the number of months since the mostrecent breast exam and Pap smear.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada.

La BDSPS est une base de données statistiques représentatives et non confidentielles des individus dans le contexte de leur famille, avec suffisamment d’information sur chaque individu pour permettre le calcul des taxes et impôts payés au gouvernement ainsi que des montants remis par les gouvernements.<br>2. Le MSPS est un modèle comptable statique qui fait le traitement de chaque individu et de chaque famille qu’il y a dans la BDSPS, calcule les taxes et impôts ainsi que les transferts avec des algorithmes qui simulent les programmes adoptés ou proposés, et établit des rapports sur les résultats. Un environnement logiciel perfectionné donne à l’utilisateur beaucoup d’influence sur les entrées et les sorties du modèle et lui permet de modifier les programmes existants ou d’examiner des projets entièrement nouveaux. À l’intérieur du MSPS, il y a deux modèles configurés comme deux programmes informatiques distincts.<br>2a. Le programme central, le MSPS, est un modèle de microsimulation qui calcule les taxes, les impôts et les transferts pour les individus et les familles. Ces calculs sont exécutés pour quiconque se trouve dans la BDSPS et les résultats sont alors agrégés de façon à produire des estimations. Le MSPS est un modèle d’incidence statique et il ne vise pas à simuler la façon dont le comportement d’un individu est susceptible de changer en réaction à diverses options de politique.

Ce modèle ne fait pas partie du progiciel BD/MSPS dans sa version actuelle, mais ce sont les résultats obtenus avec lui qui en font partie. COMTAX donne une estimation des taxes de vente fédérales et provinciales ainsi que des taxes à la consommation équivalentes par province, par ménage, par catégorie de dépenses et par type de taxe. Ce modèle est nécessaire parce que de nombreuses taxes à la consommation sont prélevées à diverses étapes de la production et non à l’étape de la vente au détail. Les taux calculés par le modèle COMTAX peuvent être utilisés comme paramètres à l’entrée du MSPS afin de produire des estimations des taxes à la consommation payées, directement et indirectement, par tout ménage donné.<br>3.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region.

The National Crime Victimization Survey, Concatenated File, [United States], 1992-2016: Revised Version (ICPSR 37241) data collection contains the official 1992-2016 NCVS data and replaces the previously published National Crime Victimization Survey, Concatenated File, [United States], 1992-2016 (ICPSR 36834) Public-Use Files. The initial files remain available for research purposes.The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously called the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as ""personal"" or ""property."" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A ""household respondent"" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.This dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2016. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.For additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 36828.","United States.

"Reconstruction of Oliver Benson's ""Simple Diplomatic Game""",1965,"Krend, Jeffery","This data collection contains a revised version of the  Simple Diplomatic Game, one of the first all-computer simulations  in the international relations field developed by Oliver Benson  in 1959. It represents an early attempt to articulate a number of  ""loose"" assumptions about international behavior into a set of  computer instructions such that high-speed computing equipment can  be used to simulate a variety of international crises situations. The earlier computer simulation program is reconstructed in this  study for 25 nations in 1965 for the purpose of examining the  advantages and disadvantages inherent in these simulations and  gauging what might be expected of computer simulation methodology  in general. The main data matrix contains nine categories of  indicators of natural and technical resources used in computing  the war potential of each nation, values for nine indicators of  aggressiveness used for computing the propensity-to-act index, a  numeric code (0-4) indicating alliance membership, a one or zero  indicating the nuclear or non-nuclear status of each country, a  tally of losses suffered by each coalition member as a result of  an unsuccessful initiative on the part of the coalition leader, a  statistic for total exports and imports for each country, degrees  of longitude for a major industrial area in each country, and  degrees of latitude for these industrial areas.

Additional questions focused on the  respondents' knowledge of and opinions about the European Union,  including how well informed they felt about the EU, what sources of  information about the EU they used, and whether their country had benefited from being an EU member. Other variables included  respondents' expectations regarding employment, and their present and  future economic and financial situation. Opinions regarding various  European institutions, such as the European Parliament, the European  Central Bank, and the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union were elicited. Respondents were asked whether issues such as defense, currency, and cultural policy should be handled by the nation's government or jointly with the EU, and whether issues such aswelcoming new member countries, protecting the environment, or fighting terrorism were priorities the EU should undertake. Respondents were asked whether it was a good thing that the euro replaced their national currency, how comfortable they felt using the euro, to what degree they were attached to the single currency, whether they still felt a personal attachment to their previouscurrency, whether they felt that in the conversion to the euro, prices had generally been rounded down, rounded up, or not rounded at all, and whether they felt this was the case in all areas or only in certain areas. Respondents were further queried on their views regarding the EU enlargement. Specifically, respondents were asked how informed they were about the EU enlargement, whether they had read, seen, or been told about the enlargement via various media such as radio, newspapers, television, the Internet, books, brochures, or national or regional government offices, whether they were in favor of or opposed to particular countries joining the EU, their preferred option for the immediate future of the EU with regard to the enlargement (i.e., whether the EU should include all, some, or none of the countries wishing to join), whether certain groups (small or large businesses, the elderly, and ethnic minorities) would benefit or lose out as a result of enlargement, and whether they agreed or disagreed with statements regarding the EU enlargement (e.g., having more  countries in the EU will mean more guaranteed peace and security in Europe, the EU should financially help future member countries before they join, and the EU should reform the way its institutions work before welcoming new members). Questions regarding financial services probed for respondents' opinions on whether consumer protection standards should be harmonized within the EU, obstacles preventing consumers from using financial services in the EU, and what sort of feelings the respondent had when thinking about their finances andfinancial services (e.g., comforted or intimidated). Respondents were asked to identify their top three financial priorities, choosing from the following: paying bills, paying off debt, buying a house, providing financial security for family in the event of unemployment, and saving for emergencies or retirement. Respondents were also asked to provide information on whether they had a checkbook, credit cards, life insurance policy, car and other loans, mortgage, or stocks/shares, and whether they would consider obtaining any of these items from another country. The survey also collected information on respondents' preferred method of paying for significant purchases (e.g., with cash, check, credit card, or bank transfer) inside and outside of their own country, and the reasons for this payment preference. Finally, respondents indicated whether or not they agreed with a series of statements regarding financial institutions, such as (1) having a bank account is too expensive, (2) buying on credit is more useful than dangerous, (3) the marketing techniques of financial institutions are aggressive, (4) financial transactions are generally secure, and (5) transactions on the Internet are generally secure. Demographic and other background information collected includes respondents' age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of education, household income, type and size of locality, and region of residence.","Christensen, Thomas.

"Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES): 2003 Cohort [United States]",2003,"United States Department of Health and Human Services. Administration for Children and Families. Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation","The Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) is an ongoing national longitudinal study of the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development of Head Start children. It examines the characteristics, well-being, and accomplishments of families, the observed quality of Head Start classrooms, and the characteristics and opinions of Head Start teachers and other program staff. FACES was designed to address four central questions related to program performance objectives:  Does Head Start enhance children's development and school readiness? Does Head Start strengthen families as the primary nurturers of their children? Does head Start provide children with high quality educational, health, and nutritional services? How is classroom quality related to child outcomes?  The FACES 2003 Cohort involved a nationally representative sample of children and families in Head Start programs in the United States who were studied at entry into the program in the fall of 2003, assessed at the completion of their program experience, and followed up at the end of their kindergarten year. The FACES 2003 battery has five main components: the child assessment, parent interview, teacher and staff interviews, classroom observations and teacher-child reports.  The child assessments included the major components of school readiness, and were collected through direct child assessments and rating scales completed by parents and teachers. Some of the direct child assessments included the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Third Edition-Revised (PPVT-III), Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, story and print concepts, social awareness, color names and one-to-one counting and assessor ratings. The parent interview was designed to provide Head Start with a comprehensive understanding of the families that they serve, including the characteristics of households and household members, levels and types of participation in the program and in other community services, involvement with their children, and an understanding of their children's development. In addition to this, parents were asked to rate each child on a set of behaviors that assessed the child's basic social skills and behavior problems. The teacher and staff interview was designed to provide information on Head Start personnel experience, education, and training as well as knowledge and beliefs about child development, and educational activities with children and parents. The classroom observations were designed to measure peer interactions, friendships of children, and the extent to which Head Start programs employed skilled teachers and provided developmentally appropriate environments and curricula for their children. Some of the assessments used included the Assessment Profile, Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R), classroom observation of teacher-directed activities, and the Arnett Caregiver Interaction Scale. The teacher-child report was designed to capture important sources of information about children's learning and behavior through the use of the Teacher-Child Report (TCR), social skills ratings, the Behavior Problems scale and the Preschool Learning Behavior Scale (PLBS).

"Impact of the Court Process on Sexually Abused Children in North Carolina, 1983-1986",1983,"King, Nancy M.P.","This data collection examines the psychological impact of  judicial processes on child sexual abuse victims. More specifically, it  provides information on how sexual abuse and the subsequent judicial  processes affect the mental health functioning of child victims by  assessing the impact of (1) additional harm to victims from out-of-home  placement, (2) criminal prosecution of the offender/family member, (3)  subject testimony in juvenile or criminal court, and (4) family and  professional support for the children. Children were enrolled in the  study at the time that social services personnel substantiated claims  of sexual abuse, and they were followed for a period of 18 months.  Assessments of the mental health functioning of the children were made  at the time of initial investigation, five months later, and 18 months  later, using a combination of self-reports, parent and teacher reports,  and psychological tests. After obtaining informed consent from the  parent or guardian, each child was interviewed using a structured  psychiatric inventory. The specific impacts of the various judicial  processes or interventions under study were examined through  comparisons of subgroups of the sample that did and did not experience  particular interventions. The interventions included social services  investigation, court process, foster placement, and psychological  therapy. Other information in the file includes the type of sexual  abuse experienced, judicial interventions the child experienced, and  the child's level of depression, anxiety, and social adjustment.

"American Customer Satisfaction Index, 1996",1996,"Fornell, Claes","The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is a uniform and independent measure of household consumption experience. The ACSI tracks trends in customer satisfaction and provides benchmarking insights into the consumer economy for companies, industry trade associations, and government agencies. It is based on modeling customer evaluations of the quality of goods and services that are purchased in the United States and produced by both domestic and foreign firms that have substantial United States market shares. The ACSI model is a set of causal equations that link customer expectations, perceived quality, and perceived value to customer satisfaction. In turn, satisfaction is linked to consequences as defined by customer complaints and customer loyalty -- measured by price tolerance and customer retention. Customer expectations combine customers' experiences with a product or service and information about it via media, advertising, salespersons, and word-of-mouth. Customer expectations influence the evaluation of quality and forecast how well the product or service will perform. Perceived quality of a product or service is measured through questions on its overall quality, reliability, and the extent to which it meets the customer's needs. Perceived value is measured through questions on overall price given quality and overall quality given price. Customer complaints activity is measured as the percentage of respondents who reported a problem with the measured company's product or service within a specified time frame. Satisfaction has an inverse relationship to customer complaints. Customer loyalty is measured through questions on the likelihood that customers will purchase a company's products or services at various price points. The ACSI is produced through a partnership of the University of Michigan Business School, the American Society for Quality (ASQ), and the international consulting firm, CFI Group. Background variables include age, education, number of family members, Hispanic origin, race, household income, sex,industry, and sector of the economy.","Fornell, Claes.

"Neuron-enriched gene expression patterns are regionally anti-correlated with oligodendrocyte-enriched patterns in the adult mouse and human brain",2018,"Pavlidis, Paul","Abstract:An important goal in neuroscience is to understand gene expression patterns in the brain. The recent availability of comprehensive and detailed expression atlases for mouse and human creates opportunities to discover global patterns and perform cross-species comparisons. Recently we reported that the major source of variation in gene transcript expression in the adult normal mouse brain can be parsimoniously explained as reflecting regional variation in glia to neuron ratios, and is correlated with degree of connectivity and location in the brain along the anterior-posterior axis. Here we extend this investigation to two gene expression assays of adult normal human brains that consisted of over 300 brain region samples, and perform comparative analyses of brain-wide expression patterns to the mouse. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the regional gene expression of the adult human brain to identify the expression pattern that has the largest variance. As in the mouse, we observed that the first principal component is composed of two anti-correlated patterns enriched in oligodendrocyte and neuron markers respectively. However, we also observed interesting discordant patterns between the two species. For example, a few mouse neuron markers show expression patterns that are more correlated with the human oligodendrocyte-enriched pattern and vice-versa. In conclusion, our work provides insights into human brain function and evolution by probing global relationships between regional cell type marker expression patterns in the human and mouse brain.","Tan PPC, French L, Pavlidis P.

Each year, data are obtained from a nationally representative sample of about 240,000 interviews on criminal victimization, involving 160,000 unique persons in about 95,000 households. Persons are interviewed on the frequency, characteristics, and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States. The NCVS collects information on nonfatal personal crimes (i.e., rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and personal larceny) and household property crimes (i.e., burglary/trespassing, motor-vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and not reported to police. Survey respondents provide information about themselves (e.g., age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, marital status, education level, and income) and whether they experienced a victimization. For each victimization incident, the NCVS collects information about the offender (e.g., age, race and Hispanic origin, sex, and victim-offender relationship), characteristics of the crime (e.g., time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences), whether the crime was reported to police, reasons the crime was or was not reported, and victim experiences with the criminal justice system.The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of households in the U.S. Once selected, households remain in the sample for 3.5 years, and eligible persons in these households are interviewed every 6 months, either in person or over the phone, for a total of seven interviews.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/icpsr/37570.xml

"Enquête sur la population active, mars 2011 [Canada]",2011,Statistique  Canada ,"L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.",,,https://odesi.ca/#/details?uri=/dlimf/ca-statcan-107070-f.xml
