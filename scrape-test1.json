This data collection focused on the presidential election that\n took place on November 7, 2000. Respondents were asked about the\n extent of their personal interest in and concern about the situation\n in the country five days after the election. Questions examined\n opinions on the way various groups were handling the election,\n including Vice President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's\n campaigns, local officials in Florida, and the news media. Respondents\n were also asked whom they wanted to see become the next\n president. Opinions were elicited on the need for a new presidential\n election in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the entire state of\n Florida, in other states where election results were very close, and\n across the entire country. Additional topics covered whether George\n W. Bush and Al Gore should accept the recount in Florida or should ask\n courts to look into whether the voting was unfair and if they should ask\n for a recount in other states where the results were very close. Those\n polled expressed their views about electing the president by direct\n popular vote versus by the Electoral College, their confidence about\n the accuracy of Florida's recount, and whether the ballot that was\n used in Palm Beach County was fair. The survey also investigated what\n impact the unclear post-election situation would have, especially on\n the country's system of presidential elections. Background information\n on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, party\naffiliation, political orientation, and voter registration.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"ABC News.

For the first major area of focus, poverty and social exclusion, the survey queried respondents about their own definition of poverty, the extent of poverty and homelessness in their area, and whether or not respondents believed poverty had increased in their area and elsewhere. Respondents were queried about what necessities people must be able to afford to meet a minimal acceptable living standard, who is most at risk for poverty, as well as the social, political, and personal causes of poverty and homelessness. Respondents were also asked about how poverty impacts peoples’ chances of completing certain activities, such as getting a good education or finding a job. Respondents were then asked whether or not they trust the European Union (EU), their governments, charities, other citizens, and miscellaneous institutions to effectively respond to poverty. Respondents were also asked to whom they assign primary responsibility for reducing or preventing poverty, what policies their governments should focus on in the future in the effort to help people out of poverty, and whether or not respondents approved of their government’s existing anti-poverty measures. Respondents were also queried about their perception of social tensions between groups, and about what they have done personally to help poor people. Additionally, respondents were queried about their own living conditions, satisfaction with life, ability to keep a job, efforts to fight poverty, finances, and their own risk of falling into poverty. For the second major area of focus, mobile phone use, the survey asked respondents about whether or not they owned a mobile phone, their mobile phone use in other EU countries, and the cost of cellular phone service in those countries. For the third major area of focus, economic crisis, the survey questioned respondents about the degree to which the crisis personally affected them, how the crisis affected the EU and its policy efforts, who should bear responsibility for the crisis, who should bear the burden of response to the crisis, and how the European Parliament and other bodies should respond to the crisis. For the fourth major area of focus, international trade, the survey queried respondents on whether they pay attention to the country of origin for products they purchase, how trade impacts respondents and their countries, what European Union trade policy should be going into the future, and the European Union’s international economic standing. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.

Another major focus of the surveys was to ask respondents to express their opinion in regard to the European Constitution, including its adoption and ratification. Respondents also were asked about EU enlargement including whom they would favor to join the EU, the political, social, and economic effects of enlargement, and initiatives for the success of further EU enlargement. In addition, respondents were asked questions about exports versus imports and migration among the EU's old and new member states, the accession of Western Balkan countries and Turkey, and  financial assistance available to EU member and candidate countries. Special topics included quality of life, avian influenza, and energy issues. For the first special topic, quality of life, the survey asked respondents to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental situation among several domains, in addition to their personal financial status and quality of life, and to identify priorities for the improvement of the EU economy. For the next special topic, respondents were queried about avian influenza, its transmission,  regulations preventing its spread, their behavior in consuming poultry and eggs, dissemination of health information, and public safety. For the final special topic, respondents answered questions about their usage of energy and how the EU citizens and government could reduce energy consumption and utilize alternative resources. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, birthplace, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of full-time education, household composition, religious affiliation and involvement, and ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods.

Elle mesure l'ampleur des voyages intérieurs au Canada, du point de vue de la demande. L'enquête vise à recueillir de l'information sur le volume de voyages et des dépenses des résidents du Canada selon l'origine du voyage, la destination, la durée, le type d'hébergement utilisé, le but du voyage, le moyen de transport, etc., à recueillir de l'information sur l'incidence des voyages et fournir le profil sociodémographique des voyageurs et des non-voyageurs. Les estimations permettent d'effectuer des analyses sur une base trimestrielle à l'échelle nationale, provinciale et régionale (à divers degrés de précision) concernant les informations suivantes :\n<ul>\n\n<li> nombre total de voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus effectués par les résidents du Canada et dont la destination était au Canada;</li>\n<li> visites d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada;</li>\n<li> raison principale du voyage et activités principales effectuées pendant le voyage;</li>\n<li> dépenses effectuées pour les voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada par les résidents du Canada, au total et selon la catégorie de dépenses;</li>\n<li> moyens de transport utilisés pendant le voyage (principal/autre);</li>\n<li> visites-personnes, visites-ménages, dépenses totales et par catégorie de dépenses pour chaque endroit visité au Canada;</li>\n<li> nuitées-personnes et nuitées-ménages passées à chaque endroit visité au Canada, au total et selon le type d'hébergement utilisé;</li>\n<li> utilisation de forfaits de voyage et dépenses qui y sont associées et participation à des excursions guidées en autocar/autre;</li>\n<li> personne ou organisme ayant payé les coûts du voyage (ménage, gouvernement, employeur privé);</li>\n<li> caractéristiques démographiques des adultes qui ont effectué des voyages et ceux qui n'en n'ont pas effectués;</li>\n<li> composition du groupe des voyageurs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Les utilisateurs principaux des données de l'EVRC sont Statistique Canada, la Commission canadienne du tourisme, les provinces et les bureaux de tourisme.

As part of adapting to life in Canada, many immigrants face challenges such as finding suitable accommodation, learning or becoming more fluent in one or both of Canada's official languages, participating in the labour market or accessing education and training opportunities. The results of this survey will provide indicators of how immigrants are meeting these and other challenges. While integration may take many years, the LSIC is designed to examine the first four years of settlement, a time when newcomers establish economic, social and cultural ties to Canadian society. To this end, the objectives of the survey are two-fold: to study how new immigrants adjust to life in Canada over time; and, to provide information on the factors that can facilitate or hinder this adjustment.\n\nTopics covered in the survey include language proficiency, housing, education, foreign credential recognition, employment, health, values and attitudes, the development and use of social networks, income, and perceptions of settlement in Canada. \n\nSince immigration is a shared jurisdiction between national and provincial departments the information gathered through the LSIC will be beneficial to many groups including both federal and provincial government departments, immigrant settlement agencies, non-governmental organizations and researchers. Survey results will also play an important role in planning and developing programs that will assist future immigrants settling in Canada.\n\nNote that a public use microdata file will not be created for this survey.

The data were designed to be used\n for multivariate analysis of the factors influencing changes in\n employment status, job mobility of various types, changes in marital\n status, fertility, and residential mobility in Russia during the\n period of 1985-2001. Since the period covered by the histories spans\n the final seven years of the Soviet era and the first decade of the\n post-Soviet era, the data are uniquely suited for assessing whether\n the transition from Soviet-style socialism has affected\n stratification, family formation, and migration processes. Moreover,\n because the data include work/employment, family structure, and\n migration histories, the dataset is uniquely suited for dynamic\n analyses of the inter-relationships among states and events in these\n three domains. Finally, because the data contain information on each\n respondent's oblast (region) of residence at all points in time from\n 1985-2001, data on regional characteristics can be merged with files\n created from the survey data, in order to measure the impact of\n regional characteristics on individual-level events.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1995.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Employment and Income Interview\n The Employment and Income Interview was completed by primary\n caregivers (Cohorts 0 to 15) and subjects (Cohort 18). The interview\n contained questions regarding the employment status and income earned\n by the respondents in order to give an overview of the economic\n conditions under which the Longitudinal Cohort Study participants\n lived. Each respondent was asked to respond to questions concerning\n the details of his or her partner's employment and salary to give a\n complete summary of the household's economic situation. The response\n format for the Employment and Income Interview varied from question to\n question. Some questions were petitioned straightforward, yes or no\n responses. Other questions offered multiple choices of which the\n respondent was permitted to select the one response which best\n described their situation.

The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and November 2001 (ICPSR 4044). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the primary motor cortex. This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this aberrant neural activity is equivocal.\nOne factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is increased cortical excitatory tone within the contralesional hemisphere. While approximately 80% of the descending corticospinal neurons that control the right hand originate in the left PMC, 20% originate in the right PMC. Elevated activity in the right PMC of left-sided stroke patients may reflect compensatory activity of these descending fibers. Neural activity in the PMC reflects the balance of local excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) processing. It can be measured in two manners: electrophysiologically, using single hemisphere paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neurochemically, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nAnother factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is a loss of transcallosal inhibition between the hemispheres. During right hand movement, the left PMC of healthy individuals actively inhibits the right PMC via inhibitory projections through the corpus callosum. In left MCA stroke patients, elevated activity in the contralesional (right) PMC when moving the right hand may reflect a loss of typical inhibition from the left PMC. The integrity of inter-hemispheric information transfer can be measured in two manners: using bi-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS, and using a multimodal brain stimulation/brain imaging approach, interleaved TMS/MRI. Through interleaved TMS/MRI, researchers can selectively stimulate the ipsilesional PMC and quantify the amount of TMS-induced activity in the contralesional PMC.\nThese two explanations were tested through a cross-sectional investigation of neural function in left MCA stroke patients with mild-moderate right upper extremity impairment and controls matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. To assess the clinical relevance of these factors on motor dysfunction, the researchers performed a detailed kinematic assessment of movement efficiency, smoothness and compensation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The specific aims of this study are: to quantify the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory tone within the contralesional PMC, to quantify the level of information flow between the left and right PMC, and to quantify the relationship between neural activity and performance. The results of these aims will clarify the relative contribution of within and between hemisphere adaptations to cortical reorganization. These cross-sectional data will also be the foundation of a longitudinal R01 that will determine which patterns of laterality predict favorable treatment outcomes.

Individuals were pre-screened for eligibility on the phone by a clinical research assistant with experience working with stroke patients for research studies.

Participants performed a comprehensive assessment of motor function utilizing the resources and staff of the Quantitative Behavioral Assessment and Rehabilitation (QBAR) Core. Specifically, all stroke patients completed the Rasch modified version of the Fugl-Meyer Motor assessment battery and a kinematic assessment of both unimanual and bimanual movements using a 45 sensor 3D optical imaging system.

Teachers, administrators, and staff who agreed to participate in the study were enrolled in the iris technology system and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group was allowed access to all doors. Parents who agreed to participate were also randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Parents in the treatment group could use the front entrance of the elementary school and would be able to check out their children during school hours by using the iris scanner rather than showing identification and writing out the names of their children on a log sheet. The first wave of teacher and parent surveys were conducted about one month before the iris scanning technology was installed and wave two surveys were conducted near the end of the school year. The first teacher survey was conducted in March 2003 in the Middle School and the Elementary School during an all-staff meeting prior to the school day. Teachers and staff took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the survey while the research staff waited. School staff who could not attend the meeting or who had to leave early returned the surveys to the secretary for the Assistant Superintendent, who forwarded them to the researchers by mail. In the High School, research staff approached the teachers and staff individually during the school study hall, the teacher's break, and the lunch hours. School secretaries collected extra surveys left for teachers and staff missed due to absences. In June 2003, near the end of the school year, research staff returned and repeated the respective process to administer the second survey to the teachers and staff in the three schools.

Respondents were also asked if they had used T-PASS to sign a child out of the school, the ease of use of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, the security level of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, and problems they experienced using T-PASS to sign a child out of the school. Dataset 6, the first teacher survey, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, current position, highest level of education, years working in Plumsted Township schools and if less than five years where previously worked. Respondents were asked which school they worked in and if the school had problems with issues such as fighting, absenteeism, tardiness, bullying, theft, vandalism, drug, alcohol or tobacco use by students, and possession of weapons by students. Respondents were asked if they felt safe at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood and if they thought the children felt safe at the school and in surrounding neighborhood. Respondents were asked how many times per day they left the school during school hours, the reason for leaving and if they used a swipe card to enter the building. Variables were also included to gauge the respondents' use of technologies such as cell phones, voice-mail, and computers.  Finally, the respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition system (T-PASS) being implemented at the schools.The second teacher survey, Dataset 7, includes the same variables as Dataset 6, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system. Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS, to compare T-PASS to the buzzer and the swipe card systems in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had experienced any problems using T-PASS. Respondents were also asked if they had used the buzzer system to enter the school, to compare the buzzer system to T-PASS in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had any problems while trying to use the buzzer system. Finally, respondents were asked if they had gained entry into the school through other means, and to describe the other means of entry used.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Uchida, Craig D., Edward R.

This project was developed with the understanding that prevention and early intervention services for disordered gambling could be better informed by a rigorous longitudinal study of the natural progression of gambling in the general population.</p>\r\n<p>In order to examine the determinants and the course of both non-problematic gambling and problem gambling, the LLLP surveys collected data on a number of gambling-specific and general aspects of the responders' lives. The LLLP contains data relating to gambling-specific information, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>demographics;</li>\r\n<li>past year and lifetime gambling behaviour;</li>\r\n<li>gambling attitudes and beliefs in gambling fallacies;</li>\r\n<li>motivations for gambling;</li>\r\n<li>stigma experienced from gambling; and</li>\r\n<li>family history of gambling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to gambling-specific data, the LLLP survey contains a number of general data variables, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>general/physical health;</li>\r\n<li>psychological factors (personality and temperament, psychopathology, coping strategies);</li>\r\n<li>comorbid factors (ADHD, eating disorders, substance use disorders);</li>\r\n<li>cultural factors (religiosity) and;</li>\r\n<li>social factors (social support/networks, non-gambling activity participation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A sample of 1,808 participants was recruited from four diverse regions of Alberta: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, and Grand Prairie.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2009.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered in\n the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Family Mental Health and Legal History\n Administered between 1994 and 1997, the Family Mental Health and\n Legal History instrument was completed by primary caregivers of\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 0 to 18 of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort\n Study. Respondents answered either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to questions\n inquiring about the family's history with alcohol and drug abuse,\n depression, nervous breakdowns, suicide, frequent fighting, trouble\n keeping a job, and frequent discipline problems. For each \"Yes\"\n response, respondents also provided the family member's relation to\n the subject (e.g., biological, nonbiological, maternal, paternal, or\n parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or other). Up to 15 family\n members could have been mentioned for each question asked. The\n instrument was also used to gather information on treatment and\n hospitalization for substance abuse or emotional problems. For those\n family members mentioned as having a history of mental health issues,\n questions were asked concerning any trouble they may have had with the\n police, if they had ever been arrested, and whether they were serving\nany time in a jail or prison.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"In addition to the variables containing the\n responses to the Family Mental Health and Legal History instrument,\n the data contain administrative variables that record identification\n numbers for respondents and interviewers, cohort, and wave number, as\nwell as the time and date each interview was completed.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them. Additional questions asked respondents whether they had any close friends or relatives who filed for bankruptcy or had a foreclosure in the past year, whether they had any money invested in the stock market, and whether they thought investment in the stock market was safe.  Other topics addressed the war in Iraq, the home mortgage crisis, estate and income tax, trade restrictions, and race relations. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, employment status, marital status, whether respondents had children under 18 years of age, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News, and The New York Times.

SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective\nobservational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled\nclinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from\npatients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care,\ntreatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among\ncritically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for\ndevising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill\npatients' care and for the construction of statistical models for\npredicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention\nwas implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients\nduring 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with\naccurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival\nprobability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life\ncare. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the\nintervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance\nunderstanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance\nplanning. The intervention was expected to increase communication,\nresulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation,\ndecrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the\nIntensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase\nphysician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease\npatient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in\nboth phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to\npatients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for\nabstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II\nalso collected information regarding the implementation of the\nintervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses\nassigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients\nwere followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who\ndid not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched\nagainst the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. The\nHELP study was conducted in 1993 concomitantly with Phase II of\nSUPPORT and collected data to characterize the care, treatment\npreferences, and patterns of decision-making among hospitalized\npatients who were at least 80 years old. HELP data were also intended\nfor use in adapting existing mortality and functional status models of\nelderly hospitalized patients. Data collection methods of HELP were\nessentially the same as those of SUPPORT. HELP patients were followed\nfor 12 months after inclusion in the study.

The interview asked specific questions on membership breadth, such as the number of different stakeholder groups that participated in the collaboration; aspects of implementation, such as their use of formal resources and structures to organize their work; and extent to which they institutionalize various collaborative activities into their teamwork in order to promote change. Based on these features, cluster analysis was used to empirically derive patterns of SART implementation.\n\n\nStudy 2 Network Analysis sought to deepen the understanding of how SART structure relates to SART perceived effectiveness by examining the structure of inter-organizational relationships within SARTs. Based on Study 1 results, four model SARTs (high use of formal structures and institutionalization of collaborative activities, and all engaging in program evaluation) were sampled. Phone interviews were conducted with a key informant from each of the members of the SART. Three types of collaborative relationships were assessed: inter-organizational communication about coordinating the response to sexual assault, believing that other organizations value their organizations role in the response to sexual assault, and believing that other organizations are a resource to their organization's work in responding to sexual assault.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of \"neighborhood\" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Ludwig, Jens, Lisa Sanbonmatsu, Lisa A.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

The LFS collects monthly information on the labour market activities of Canada's working age population. This product is for users who prefer to do their own analysis by focusing on specific subgroups in the population or by cross-classifying variables that are not in our catalogued products.\n\nThis file contains both personal characteristics for all individuals in the household and detailed labour force characteristics for household members 15 years of age and over. The personal characteristics include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Detailed labour force characteristics include employment information such as class of worker, usual and actual hours of work, employee hourly and weekly wages, industry and occupation of current or most recent job, public and private sector, union status, paid or unpaid overtime hours, job permanency, hours of work lost, job tenure, and unemployment information such as duration of unemployment, methods of job search and type of job sought. Labour force characteristics are also available for students during the school year and during the summer months as well as school attendance whether full or part-time and the type of institution. These and more are available by province and for the three largest census metropolitan areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver).\n\nThis is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.\n\nLFS revisions: LFS estimates have been adjusted to reflect population counts based on the 2011 Census and includes updates to 2011 Geography classification system and were revised back to 2001.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nLeahey, A. 2017.
