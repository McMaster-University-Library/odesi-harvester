This data collection focused on the presidential election that\n took place on November 7, 2000. Respondents were asked about the\n extent of their personal interest in and concern about the situation\n in the country five days after the election. Questions examined\n opinions on the way various groups were handling the election,\n including Vice President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's\n campaigns, local officials in Florida, and the news media. Respondents\n were also asked whom they wanted to see become the next\n president. Opinions were elicited on the need for a new presidential\n election in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the entire state of\n Florida, in other states where election results were very close, and\n across the entire country. Additional topics covered whether George\n W. Bush and Al Gore should accept the recount in Florida or should ask\n courts to look into whether the voting was unfair and if they should ask\n for a recount in other states where the results were very close. Those\n polled expressed their views about electing the president by direct\n popular vote versus by the Electoral College, their confidence about\n the accuracy of Florida's recount, and whether the ballot that was\n used in Palm Beach County was fair. The survey also investigated what\n impact the unclear post-election situation would have, especially on\n the country's system of presidential elections. Background information\n on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, party\naffiliation, political orientation, and voter registration.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"ABC News.

For the first major area of focus, poverty and social exclusion, the survey queried respondents about their own definition of poverty, the extent of poverty and homelessness in their area, and whether or not respondents believed poverty had increased in their area and elsewhere. Respondents were queried about what necessities people must be able to afford to meet a minimal acceptable living standard, who is most at risk for poverty, as well as the social, political, and personal causes of poverty and homelessness. Respondents were also asked about how poverty impacts peoples’ chances of completing certain activities, such as getting a good education or finding a job. Respondents were then asked whether or not they trust the European Union (EU), their governments, charities, other citizens, and miscellaneous institutions to effectively respond to poverty. Respondents were also asked to whom they assign primary responsibility for reducing or preventing poverty, what policies their governments should focus on in the future in the effort to help people out of poverty, and whether or not respondents approved of their government’s existing anti-poverty measures. Respondents were also queried about their perception of social tensions between groups, and about what they have done personally to help poor people. Additionally, respondents were queried about their own living conditions, satisfaction with life, ability to keep a job, efforts to fight poverty, finances, and their own risk of falling into poverty. For the second major area of focus, mobile phone use, the survey asked respondents about whether or not they owned a mobile phone, their mobile phone use in other EU countries, and the cost of cellular phone service in those countries. For the third major area of focus, economic crisis, the survey questioned respondents about the degree to which the crisis personally affected them, how the crisis affected the EU and its policy efforts, who should bear responsibility for the crisis, who should bear the burden of response to the crisis, and how the European Parliament and other bodies should respond to the crisis. For the fourth major area of focus, international trade, the survey queried respondents on whether they pay attention to the country of origin for products they purchase, how trade impacts respondents and their countries, what European Union trade policy should be going into the future, and the European Union’s international economic standing. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.

Another major focus of the surveys was to ask respondents to express their opinion in regard to the European Constitution, including its adoption and ratification. Respondents also were asked about EU enlargement including whom they would favor to join the EU, the political, social, and economic effects of enlargement, and initiatives for the success of further EU enlargement. In addition, respondents were asked questions about exports versus imports and migration among the EU's old and new member states, the accession of Western Balkan countries and Turkey, and  financial assistance available to EU member and candidate countries. Special topics included quality of life, avian influenza, and energy issues. For the first special topic, quality of life, the survey asked respondents to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental situation among several domains, in addition to their personal financial status and quality of life, and to identify priorities for the improvement of the EU economy. For the next special topic, respondents were queried about avian influenza, its transmission,  regulations preventing its spread, their behavior in consuming poultry and eggs, dissemination of health information, and public safety. For the final special topic, respondents answered questions about their usage of energy and how the EU citizens and government could reduce energy consumption and utilize alternative resources. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, birthplace, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of full-time education, household composition, religious affiliation and involvement, and ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods.

Elle mesure l'ampleur des voyages intérieurs au Canada, du point de vue de la demande. L'enquête vise à recueillir de l'information sur le volume de voyages et des dépenses des résidents du Canada selon l'origine du voyage, la destination, la durée, le type d'hébergement utilisé, le but du voyage, le moyen de transport, etc., à recueillir de l'information sur l'incidence des voyages et fournir le profil sociodémographique des voyageurs et des non-voyageurs. Les estimations permettent d'effectuer des analyses sur une base trimestrielle à l'échelle nationale, provinciale et régionale (à divers degrés de précision) concernant les informations suivantes :\n<ul>\n\n<li> nombre total de voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus effectués par les résidents du Canada et dont la destination était au Canada;</li>\n<li> visites d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada;</li>\n<li> raison principale du voyage et activités principales effectuées pendant le voyage;</li>\n<li> dépenses effectuées pour les voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada par les résidents du Canada, au total et selon la catégorie de dépenses;</li>\n<li> moyens de transport utilisés pendant le voyage (principal/autre);</li>\n<li> visites-personnes, visites-ménages, dépenses totales et par catégorie de dépenses pour chaque endroit visité au Canada;</li>\n<li> nuitées-personnes et nuitées-ménages passées à chaque endroit visité au Canada, au total et selon le type d'hébergement utilisé;</li>\n<li> utilisation de forfaits de voyage et dépenses qui y sont associées et participation à des excursions guidées en autocar/autre;</li>\n<li> personne ou organisme ayant payé les coûts du voyage (ménage, gouvernement, employeur privé);</li>\n<li> caractéristiques démographiques des adultes qui ont effectué des voyages et ceux qui n'en n'ont pas effectués;</li>\n<li> composition du groupe des voyageurs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Les utilisateurs principaux des données de l'EVRC sont Statistique Canada, la Commission canadienne du tourisme, les provinces et les bureaux de tourisme.

As part of adapting to life in Canada, many immigrants face challenges such as finding suitable accommodation, learning or becoming more fluent in one or both of Canada's official languages, participating in the labour market or accessing education and training opportunities. The results of this survey will provide indicators of how immigrants are meeting these and other challenges. While integration may take many years, the LSIC is designed to examine the first four years of settlement, a time when newcomers establish economic, social and cultural ties to Canadian society. To this end, the objectives of the survey are two-fold: to study how new immigrants adjust to life in Canada over time; and, to provide information on the factors that can facilitate or hinder this adjustment.\n\nTopics covered in the survey include language proficiency, housing, education, foreign credential recognition, employment, health, values and attitudes, the development and use of social networks, income, and perceptions of settlement in Canada. \n\nSince immigration is a shared jurisdiction between national and provincial departments the information gathered through the LSIC will be beneficial to many groups including both federal and provincial government departments, immigrant settlement agencies, non-governmental organizations and researchers. Survey results will also play an important role in planning and developing programs that will assist future immigrants settling in Canada.\n\nNote that a public use microdata file will not be created for this survey.

The data were designed to be used\n for multivariate analysis of the factors influencing changes in\n employment status, job mobility of various types, changes in marital\n status, fertility, and residential mobility in Russia during the\n period of 1985-2001. Since the period covered by the histories spans\n the final seven years of the Soviet era and the first decade of the\n post-Soviet era, the data are uniquely suited for assessing whether\n the transition from Soviet-style socialism has affected\n stratification, family formation, and migration processes. Moreover,\n because the data include work/employment, family structure, and\n migration histories, the dataset is uniquely suited for dynamic\n analyses of the inter-relationships among states and events in these\n three domains. Finally, because the data contain information on each\n respondent's oblast (region) of residence at all points in time from\n 1985-2001, data on regional characteristics can be merged with files\n created from the survey data, in order to measure the impact of\n regional characteristics on individual-level events.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1995.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Employment and Income Interview\n The Employment and Income Interview was completed by primary\n caregivers (Cohorts 0 to 15) and subjects (Cohort 18). The interview\n contained questions regarding the employment status and income earned\n by the respondents in order to give an overview of the economic\n conditions under which the Longitudinal Cohort Study participants\n lived. Each respondent was asked to respond to questions concerning\n the details of his or her partner's employment and salary to give a\n complete summary of the household's economic situation. The response\n format for the Employment and Income Interview varied from question to\n question. Some questions were petitioned straightforward, yes or no\n responses. Other questions offered multiple choices of which the\n respondent was permitted to select the one response which best\n described their situation.

The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and November 2001 (ICPSR 4044). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the primary motor cortex. This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this aberrant neural activity is equivocal.\nOne factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is increased cortical excitatory tone within the contralesional hemisphere. While approximately 80% of the descending corticospinal neurons that control the right hand originate in the left PMC, 20% originate in the right PMC. Elevated activity in the right PMC of left-sided stroke patients may reflect compensatory activity of these descending fibers. Neural activity in the PMC reflects the balance of local excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) processing. It can be measured in two manners: electrophysiologically, using single hemisphere paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neurochemically, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nAnother factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is a loss of transcallosal inhibition between the hemispheres. During right hand movement, the left PMC of healthy individuals actively inhibits the right PMC via inhibitory projections through the corpus callosum. In left MCA stroke patients, elevated activity in the contralesional (right) PMC when moving the right hand may reflect a loss of typical inhibition from the left PMC. The integrity of inter-hemispheric information transfer can be measured in two manners: using bi-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS, and using a multimodal brain stimulation/brain imaging approach, interleaved TMS/MRI. Through interleaved TMS/MRI, researchers can selectively stimulate the ipsilesional PMC and quantify the amount of TMS-induced activity in the contralesional PMC.\nThese two explanations were tested through a cross-sectional investigation of neural function in left MCA stroke patients with mild-moderate right upper extremity impairment and controls matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. To assess the clinical relevance of these factors on motor dysfunction, the researchers performed a detailed kinematic assessment of movement efficiency, smoothness and compensation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The specific aims of this study are: to quantify the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory tone within the contralesional PMC, to quantify the level of information flow between the left and right PMC, and to quantify the relationship between neural activity and performance. The results of these aims will clarify the relative contribution of within and between hemisphere adaptations to cortical reorganization. These cross-sectional data will also be the foundation of a longitudinal R01 that will determine which patterns of laterality predict favorable treatment outcomes.

Individuals were pre-screened for eligibility on the phone by a clinical research assistant with experience working with stroke patients for research studies.

Participants performed a comprehensive assessment of motor function utilizing the resources and staff of the Quantitative Behavioral Assessment and Rehabilitation (QBAR) Core. Specifically, all stroke patients completed the Rasch modified version of the Fugl-Meyer Motor assessment battery and a kinematic assessment of both unimanual and bimanual movements using a 45 sensor 3D optical imaging system.

Teachers, administrators, and staff who agreed to participate in the study were enrolled in the iris technology system and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group was allowed access to all doors. Parents who agreed to participate were also randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Parents in the treatment group could use the front entrance of the elementary school and would be able to check out their children during school hours by using the iris scanner rather than showing identification and writing out the names of their children on a log sheet. The first wave of teacher and parent surveys were conducted about one month before the iris scanning technology was installed and wave two surveys were conducted near the end of the school year. The first teacher survey was conducted in March 2003 in the Middle School and the Elementary School during an all-staff meeting prior to the school day. Teachers and staff took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the survey while the research staff waited. School staff who could not attend the meeting or who had to leave early returned the surveys to the secretary for the Assistant Superintendent, who forwarded them to the researchers by mail. In the High School, research staff approached the teachers and staff individually during the school study hall, the teacher's break, and the lunch hours. School secretaries collected extra surveys left for teachers and staff missed due to absences. In June 2003, near the end of the school year, research staff returned and repeated the respective process to administer the second survey to the teachers and staff in the three schools.

Respondents were also asked if they had used T-PASS to sign a child out of the school, the ease of use of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, the security level of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, and problems they experienced using T-PASS to sign a child out of the school. Dataset 6, the first teacher survey, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, current position, highest level of education, years working in Plumsted Township schools and if less than five years where previously worked. Respondents were asked which school they worked in and if the school had problems with issues such as fighting, absenteeism, tardiness, bullying, theft, vandalism, drug, alcohol or tobacco use by students, and possession of weapons by students. Respondents were asked if they felt safe at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood and if they thought the children felt safe at the school and in surrounding neighborhood. Respondents were asked how many times per day they left the school during school hours, the reason for leaving and if they used a swipe card to enter the building. Variables were also included to gauge the respondents' use of technologies such as cell phones, voice-mail, and computers.  Finally, the respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition system (T-PASS) being implemented at the schools.The second teacher survey, Dataset 7, includes the same variables as Dataset 6, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system. Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS, to compare T-PASS to the buzzer and the swipe card systems in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had experienced any problems using T-PASS. Respondents were also asked if they had used the buzzer system to enter the school, to compare the buzzer system to T-PASS in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had any problems while trying to use the buzzer system. Finally, respondents were asked if they had gained entry into the school through other means, and to describe the other means of entry used.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Uchida, Craig D., Edward R.

This project was developed with the understanding that prevention and early intervention services for disordered gambling could be better informed by a rigorous longitudinal study of the natural progression of gambling in the general population.</p>\r\n<p>In order to examine the determinants and the course of both non-problematic gambling and problem gambling, the LLLP surveys collected data on a number of gambling-specific and general aspects of the responders' lives. The LLLP contains data relating to gambling-specific information, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>demographics;</li>\r\n<li>past year and lifetime gambling behaviour;</li>\r\n<li>gambling attitudes and beliefs in gambling fallacies;</li>\r\n<li>motivations for gambling;</li>\r\n<li>stigma experienced from gambling; and</li>\r\n<li>family history of gambling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to gambling-specific data, the LLLP survey contains a number of general data variables, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>general/physical health;</li>\r\n<li>psychological factors (personality and temperament, psychopathology, coping strategies);</li>\r\n<li>comorbid factors (ADHD, eating disorders, substance use disorders);</li>\r\n<li>cultural factors (religiosity) and;</li>\r\n<li>social factors (social support/networks, non-gambling activity participation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A sample of 1,808 participants was recruited from four diverse regions of Alberta: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, and Grand Prairie.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2009.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered in\n the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Family Mental Health and Legal History\n Administered between 1994 and 1997, the Family Mental Health and\n Legal History instrument was completed by primary caregivers of\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 0 to 18 of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort\n Study. Respondents answered either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to questions\n inquiring about the family's history with alcohol and drug abuse,\n depression, nervous breakdowns, suicide, frequent fighting, trouble\n keeping a job, and frequent discipline problems. For each \"Yes\"\n response, respondents also provided the family member's relation to\n the subject (e.g., biological, nonbiological, maternal, paternal, or\n parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or other). Up to 15 family\n members could have been mentioned for each question asked. The\n instrument was also used to gather information on treatment and\n hospitalization for substance abuse or emotional problems. For those\n family members mentioned as having a history of mental health issues,\n questions were asked concerning any trouble they may have had with the\n police, if they had ever been arrested, and whether they were serving\nany time in a jail or prison.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"In addition to the variables containing the\n responses to the Family Mental Health and Legal History instrument,\n the data contain administrative variables that record identification\n numbers for respondents and interviewers, cohort, and wave number, as\nwell as the time and date each interview was completed.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them. Additional questions asked respondents whether they had any close friends or relatives who filed for bankruptcy or had a foreclosure in the past year, whether they had any money invested in the stock market, and whether they thought investment in the stock market was safe.  Other topics addressed the war in Iraq, the home mortgage crisis, estate and income tax, trade restrictions, and race relations. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, employment status, marital status, whether respondents had children under 18 years of age, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News, and The New York Times.

SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective\nobservational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled\nclinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from\npatients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care,\ntreatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among\ncritically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for\ndevising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill\npatients' care and for the construction of statistical models for\npredicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention\nwas implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients\nduring 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with\naccurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival\nprobability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life\ncare. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the\nintervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance\nunderstanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance\nplanning. The intervention was expected to increase communication,\nresulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation,\ndecrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the\nIntensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase\nphysician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease\npatient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in\nboth phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to\npatients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for\nabstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II\nalso collected information regarding the implementation of the\nintervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses\nassigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients\nwere followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who\ndid not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched\nagainst the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. The\nHELP study was conducted in 1993 concomitantly with Phase II of\nSUPPORT and collected data to characterize the care, treatment\npreferences, and patterns of decision-making among hospitalized\npatients who were at least 80 years old. HELP data were also intended\nfor use in adapting existing mortality and functional status models of\nelderly hospitalized patients. Data collection methods of HELP were\nessentially the same as those of SUPPORT. HELP patients were followed\nfor 12 months after inclusion in the study.

The interview asked specific questions on membership breadth, such as the number of different stakeholder groups that participated in the collaboration; aspects of implementation, such as their use of formal resources and structures to organize their work; and extent to which they institutionalize various collaborative activities into their teamwork in order to promote change. Based on these features, cluster analysis was used to empirically derive patterns of SART implementation.\n\n\nStudy 2 Network Analysis sought to deepen the understanding of how SART structure relates to SART perceived effectiveness by examining the structure of inter-organizational relationships within SARTs. Based on Study 1 results, four model SARTs (high use of formal structures and institutionalization of collaborative activities, and all engaging in program evaluation) were sampled. Phone interviews were conducted with a key informant from each of the members of the SART. Three types of collaborative relationships were assessed: inter-organizational communication about coordinating the response to sexual assault, believing that other organizations value their organizations role in the response to sexual assault, and believing that other organizations are a resource to their organization's work in responding to sexual assault.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of \"neighborhood\" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Ludwig, Jens, Lisa Sanbonmatsu, Lisa A.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

The LFS collects monthly information on the labour market activities of Canada's working age population. This product is for users who prefer to do their own analysis by focusing on specific subgroups in the population or by cross-classifying variables that are not in our catalogued products.\n\nThis file contains both personal characteristics for all individuals in the household and detailed labour force characteristics for household members 15 years of age and over. The personal characteristics include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Detailed labour force characteristics include employment information such as class of worker, usual and actual hours of work, employee hourly and weekly wages, industry and occupation of current or most recent job, public and private sector, union status, paid or unpaid overtime hours, job permanency, hours of work lost, job tenure, and unemployment information such as duration of unemployment, methods of job search and type of job sought. Labour force characteristics are also available for students during the school year and during the summer months as well as school attendance whether full or part-time and the type of institution. These and more are available by province and for the three largest census metropolitan areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver).\n\nThis is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.\n\nLFS revisions: LFS estimates have been adjusted to reflect population counts based on the 2011 Census and includes updates to 2011 Geography classification system and were revised back to 2001.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nLeahey, A. 2017.

Prior to participation,\n subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health\n status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,\n medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use.

Derived from the extract of the capsicum pepper plant,\n OC spray causes inflammation and edema over areas of contact\n (primarily the face, eyes, nose, and mouth), resulting in pain and\n discomfort such that many suspects lose their capacity to resist. With\n widespread use, however, OC spray as a use-of-force method has been\n alleged in the media to have been associated with a number of\n in-custody deaths. Because symptoms of coughing, gagging, and\n shortness of breath are common with OC exposure, concern has focused\n on the respiratory effects of OC spray as playing a potential role in\n these deaths. Moreover, individuals subdued with OC spray in the field\n often require physical restraint, including the prone maximal\n restraint or hobble position. Some have argued that OC in combination\n with restraint can lead to significant respiratory compromise and risk\n for asphyxiation and death. While capsaicin, the active ingredient of\n OC, has been studied extensively in the medical literature for its\n ability to induce coughing, few studies on the physiologic effects of\n OC on humans have been conducted, particularly relating to respiratory\n function. In addition, no prior studies have been done on the effects\n of OC in combination with positional restraint. The goal of this study\n was to assess the safety of a commercially available OC spray in use\n by law enforcement agencies nationwide. Specifically, the researchers\n examined both OC spray and positional restraint in human subjects to\n determine if OC exposure by itself or in combination with positional\n restraint resulted in clinically significant respiratory compromise as\n measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of oxygenation\n and ventilation. Additionally, they sought to determine if OC spray by\n itself or in combination with positional restraint resulted in any\n hemodynamic compromise as measured by pulse rate and blood pressure,\n whether body size and weight influenced the effects of OC spray in\n regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, and whether pulmonary\n disease (such as asthma), the use of respiratory inhaler medications,\n or history of smoking tobacco influenced the effects of OC spray in\n regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, with both of the latter\n two measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of\noxygenation and ventilation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The study was conducted as a randomized,\n cross-over, controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited\n from the local law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,\n California.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. \n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée.

Researchers of urban social problems\n continue to struggle with this question.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Health and Human Services.

The overall research questions of this study include: (1) how demographic and socioeconomic processes at the household level, e.g. those related to family structures and livelihood systems, affect local residents' resource exploitation patterns and land use practices; (2) how local residents respond to shifts in government policy, especially the implementation of two nationwide conservation programs, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), in WNR; and (3) how household and policy dynamics interact to affect the natural environment of WNR. Example hypotheses tested in this study concerned: (1) the effects of conservation policies on local households' energy consumption patterns and fuelwood collection behaviors; (2) the connection between a household's demographic and socioeconomic background and its responses to conservation policies; (3) the relationships between social networks and labor migration; (4) the factors that affect a household's participation in nature-based tourism and the distribution of tourism benefits among different households; and (5) the potential implication of the processes described above on wildlife habitat change and conservation. The data collection in this study focuses on household demographics, household income and expenditure, fuelwood and electricity use, as well as the development of non-agricultural activities such as migration and tourism. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect yearly data of the previous year in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010 using highly structured survey questionnaires. A sample of 220 households originally drawn in 1999 was revisited in each year's survey.

Frequencies, crosstabulations, and comparison of means are used for the analyses.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"crime","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"instructional materials","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"social sciences","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"victimization","metadata-type":"element"},{"accsPlac_URI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/victimization","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"prodDate":"Please see full citation.","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2009","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Crime Victimization in the United States: A Data-Driven Learning Guide","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":130,"uri":"/icpsr/29062.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F29062.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Criminal"}," ",{"highlight":"Justice"}," ",{"highlight":"Drug"}," ",{"highlight":"Abuse"}," ",{"highlight":"Treatment"}," ",{"highlight":"Studies"}," (",{"highlight":"CJDATS"},"):  ",{"highlight":"Detention"}," ",{"highlight":"to"}," ",{"highlight":"Community"}," (",{"highlight":"DTC"},"), ",{"highlight":"2006"},"-",{"highlight":"2008"}," [",{"highlight":"United"}," ",{"highlight":"States"},"]"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":[{"highlight":"29062"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:syear","match-text":[{"highlight":"2006"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:slang","match-text":[{"highlight":"en"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/prodStmt/producer","match-text":["\n                        ",{"highlight":"Inter"},"-",{"highlight":"university"}," ",{"highlight":"Consortium"}," ",{"highlight":"for"}," ",{"highlight":"Political"}," ",{"highlight":"and"}," ",{"highlight":"Social"}]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"The Detention to Community (DTC) study addresses several priority areas of the CJDATS collaborative. First, the study will adapt existing science-based interventions in order to develop specialized services that will address drug abuse, delinquency, and sexual risk-taking among juveniles detained in detention facilities. Second, the study proposes to test an innovative, phasic, multiple-systems intervention in which the in-detention work provides a platform for the adolescent's return to the community. This bridge is created by linking the in-detention and outpatient treatment components in ways that reflect the consensus in the literature regarding the need for integrative, comprehensive interventions for criminal justice involved, substance abusing individuals (Cook, 1992; Altschuler and Armstrong, 1999). The interventions meld public health and public safety concerns, and target members in multiple systems influential to a teen’s developmental outcomes, including the adolescent’s family and school, the judiciary, and treatment providers. Thus, they go beyond the fragmented, sometimes competitive treatment models too often seen in standard criminal justice and drug treatment settings (Belenko, 2000). Third, consistent with recommendations from the literature, NIDA has designated HIV/AIDS prevention in juvenile justice facilities as an urgent public health priority (NIDA, 2002). This\nstudy would test a family-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention in comparison to standard HIV prevention. Finally, the systems-change possibilities and public policy implications of the proposed study are high, because the study would examine processes and outcomes of implementing the intervention in the real world settings in which the findings are meant to apply -- juvenile detention centers and outpatient community-based drug treatment agencies that work with young offenders (Armstrong and Altschuler, 1998).","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The fundamental objective of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness and\nevaluate the relative and net benefit-cost of a cross-context multiple-systems family-based drug\nand HIV/STD focused intervention (MDFT-CS) with substance abusing juvenile offenders in\ndetention and as they transition into the community upon release.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The study randomized consenting subjects into two treatment groups.

In particular, the extent to which\n self-reported drug use is a valid indicator of actual drug use across\n social groups has been repeatedly questioned. While patterns across\n previous studies suggest that validity differences in self-reported\n drug use do exist, these differences could not be statistically\n evaluated because of the diversity in the types of high-risk\n populations studied, the types of drug use measured, and the\n measurement procedures and conditions of each study.

Certain hospital data elements were available throughout 2006. An additional year of 2011 follow-up data was also available for a subset of patients receiving medication treatment. The purpose of the data capture was to advance patient-centered outcomes research to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cancer and other comorbidities.\nA breast cancer pilot study was also conducted from a subset of all transmitted EMR records, consisting of admission records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Using a deterministic matching algorithm a total of 11,506 unique patients were matched to a patient in the FCDS database, resulting in 12,804 primary tumors and 53,940 unique hospital admission records.  While the hospital EMR defined the patient dataset, all registry records for that patient were included in the final breast cancer pilot database, regardless of the reporting hospital or the date of diagnosis.  This was to ensure capture of the entire diagnostic and treatment profile for each breast cancer patient.\nData Access\nThese data are not available from ICPSR.

Florida DOH and FCDS began receiving these hospital records and processing/linking them with other administrative databases between December 2011 and August, 2012.  Under the guidance of Florida DOH, the Florida Cancer Data System is the organizational producer of this pilot study dataset.\nThe study tables created for this project contain data for 11,506 unique breast cancer patients who were diagnosed and/or treated between 2007-2011 at a partnering Florida hospital.  Patient hospital EMRs were linked with Florida cancer registry data.  Other administrative databases were linked for updated hospital admissions/discharge records and mortality information from across the state.\nThe study database consists of hospital records for patient clinical characteristics, health histories, comorbid conditions for which specific treatment modalities are provided, including chemotherapy and radiation, medications orders, as well as the treatment doses administered on specific dates and times.  These hospital data also contain clinicians' notes during hospitalizations and at the time of discharge, pathology reports were generated for patient laboratory tests performed.  Financial charges for services provided to patients were collected from the hospital billing department.\nOther state administrative records merged for these study tables include routinely collected data from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), hospital discharge data and ambulatory records maintained by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and mortality data collected by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics.\nPilot study data tables contain discrete and text data which include raw numeric values from hospital medical records, and include clinical notations retained in patient pathology reports and discharge summaries.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. </p>\n\n<p>Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.</p>\n\n<p>Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.</p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nLeahy, A. 2014.

The ADR will allow HAB to characterize the individuals using the program, describe the ADAP-funded services being used, and delineate the costs associated with these services.\nADAPs will begin collecting data for the ADR in October 2012.

In 2001, the federal government provided funding to establish a permanent survey program on charitable giving, volunteering and participating within Statistics Canada. The survey itself was renamed the Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP). The CSGVP was developed through a partnership of federal government departments and voluntary sector organizations. These include Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, Imagine Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Statistics Canada and Volunteer Canada. There are two data files for the 2010 Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP): the main answer file (MAIN.TXT), and the giving file (GS.TXT). For most questions in the CSGVP questionnaire, the reference period was the 12 months preceding the interview.

The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in February 2003 (ICPSR 4526) and June 2003 (ICPSR 4527). These three supplements comprise the 2003 wave of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.The TUS, like most CPS supplements, was designed to be a proxy response supplement, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members, provided the respondent was a household member 15 years of age or older. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent supplement questions. All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS core items were eligible for the November 2003 supplement items.The TUS consisted of items PEA1 through PEK5. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for certain items. Information was collected from proxies on topics such as smoking status (items PEA1-PEA3) and the use of other tobacco-related products, such as pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PEJ1a-PEJ2a).In addition to these smoking status and other tobacco use questions, self-respondents were queried on the following topics depending on their smoking/tobacco use status (i.e., every day, some days, or former cigarette smokers and/or users of other non-cigarette tobacco products):\n\nSmoking history\nCurrent cigarette smoking prevalence and consumption\nType of cigarettes smoked\nPrice of last pack/carton of cigarettes purchased and state where purchased\nMedical and dental advice to quit smoking\nAttempts and intentions to quit smoking cigarettes and/or other forms of tobacco use\nWorkplace smoking policies and smoking rules in the home\nAttitudes toward smoking in public placesAnother generally unique feature to the 2003 TUS-CPS was the administration of questions to former smokers on their previous level of addiction, products/resources/methods used to quit smoking, and advice from health\nprofessionals. This feature enables comparisons between characteristics of former smokers (or successful quitters) and current smokers attempting to quit.Administrative information was collected on who the proxy\nrespondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected include age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Justice.

The first group represented individuals who had lost loved\n ones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts\n 1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised of county criminal\n justice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court\n judges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates).\n Names and contact information for the bereaved interviews were\n obtained from: (1) death certificate records furnished by the Texas\n Department of Health, (2) local newspaper articles, and (3)\n victim/witness counselors with the county District Attorney's\n Office. Individuals were asked to participate in the study via letters\n or telephone calls. The interviews allowed interviewees to talk about\n their experiences in their own words. Each interview lasted, on\n average, two-and-a-half hours. When the interview continued for more\n than two hours, the interviewer scheduled a second meeting. Those\n interviewees living out of state were interviewed via the telephone,\n while in-person interviews took place at the bereaved respondent's\n place of residence, local restaurants, or in the office of the\n interviewer. There was one non-English speaking bereaved, whose\n interview was conducted with the help of a Spanish-English interpreter\n who also transcribed the interview. For Parts 34-55, interviews were\n conducted with county criminal justice professionals. These interviews\n took approximately an hour to complete and took place in the\n professional's office, place of residence, or at local restaurants.\n All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later transcribed\n by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of individuals,\n neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other identifiable names with\npseudonyms.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Goodrum, Sarah Dugan.

The HIUS had been conducted on a biennial basis from 1997 to 2003 to measure household Internet use. As growth in the number of households using the Internet leveled off, the survey was redesigned to focus on how individuals, rather than households, are using the Internet. The individual-level CIUS was conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009.<p/> \n\n<p>For 2010, the CIUS was redesigned to meet the measurement needs of the Broadband Canada: Connecting Rural Canadians Program, sponsored by Industry Canada. For the first time, the redesigned survey incorporated a hybrid design, consisting of both a Household Component and an Individual Component. <p/> \n\n<p>The 2012 CIUS was conducted under the 2010 design. <p/> \n\n<p>The Household Component includes a short series of questions on the type of Internet connections and devices used by household members, from home, as well as availability of high speed service, and a standard module on household income. The questions may be answered by any knowledgeable member of the household. <p/> \n\n<p>Following the Household Component, an individual aged 16 years and older was randomly selected to complete the Individual Component. Respondents were asked about their use of the Internet, and online activities including electronic commerce. While the Household Component covered Internet access at home, the Individual Component covers use of the Internet from any location. <p/> \n\n<p>The Individual Component begins with a module on Current User (CU) of the Internet. As in past years, the CIUS asks individuals about their locations of Internet use, frequency and intensity of use, and reasons for non-use. \nThe Specific Use (SU) module, as in 2010, asks respondents to report their Internet activities. These activities cover a wide range of topics including the use of email, instant messaging, formal education, and the search for employment. As with the 2010 survey, these activities could have taken place from any location and using any device. <p/> \n\n<p>The Electronic Commerce (EC) module collects information on the total number, the total cost, and the types of goods and services ordered over the internet. Additional information is also collected on the location of delivery, the means of payment, and the main reason for not participating in e-commerce. This module remained consistent with the 2010 survey. <p/> \n\n<p>The Privacy and Security (PS) module includes questions about online behaviour (e.g., use of security software, frequency of backing up files) and experiences related to security (e.g., experienced a computer virus). For the 2012 survey, this module was slightly modified with the addition of questions regarding concern for security while using internet banking or credit cards online. <p/> \n\n<p>As the 2010 and the 2012 surveys have two distinct components - household and individual - with revised and streamlined questions, it is not appropriate to make direct comparisons with results from previous years. Data users who have questions about the survey are invited to contact the Investment, Science and Technology Division (please refer to Chapter 1.0 for contact information). <p/>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nCanadian Intenet Use Survey 2012 [Canada]: Household File [public-use microdata file].

This study\nevolved out of an earlier LIFE (Living Insurance for Ex-Prisoners)\nstudy conducted in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1970s. In the LIFE\nstudy, 500 prisoners with a high probability of re-arrest were\nrandomly assigned at release from prison to experimental and control\ngroups which varied by the amount of money received (contingent upon\nemployment or unemployment and job placement services provided). The\nresults showed that ex-prisoners receiving payments were less likely\nto be re-arrested for property theft-related crimes than those who\nreceived only job placement or no services or payments of any\nkind. The United States Department of Labor commissioned the TARP\nexperiment, designed to replicate the LIFE experiment while providing\na larger and more representative sample of prisoners, greater\nvariation in treatment conditions, and administration of payments and job\nplacement services through existing agencies rather than by a special\npurpose project staff. Texas and Georgia were the states chosen for\nthe experiment, and stratified random samples of inmates were\nassigned, at the time of release from prison, to experimental and\ncontrol groups. The groups varied in the amount of money and job\nplacement services they received upon their release. Originally, the\ndata were recorded in nine files for each state corresponding to each\nof the nine different sources of information for each TARP case. The\nICPSR data collection combines these into one file for each state:\nPart 1 for Texas, and Part 2 for Georgia. Each file contains over\n1,500 variables, clustered in nine topic areas for each inmate: (1)\nprison history (e.g., background information, psychological and\naptitude test data, and prior criminal and present incarceration\nactivity), (2-5) data from four personal interviews (conducted at the\nprerelease, three-month, six-month, and 12-month stages and that\ninclude living arrangements, employment history, and financial\nstatus), (6) state arrest data, (7) records of TARP payments received,\n(8) social security wages, and (9) parole records.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Rossi, Peter, Richard A.

CCDF dollars are provided to states, territories, and tribes to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, or depending on their state's policy, to attend training or receive education. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 requires states and territories to collect information on all family units receiving assistance through the CCDF and to submit monthly case-level data to the Office of Child Care. States are permitted to report case-level data for the entire population, or a sample of the population, under approved sampling guidelines. \nThe Summary Records file contains monthly state-level summary information including the number of families served. The Family Records file contains family-level data including single parent status of the head of household, monthly co-payment amount, date on which child care assistance began, reasons for care (e.g., employment, training/education, protective services, etc.), income used to determine eligibility, source of income, and the family size on which eligibility is based. The Child Records file contains child-level data including ethnicity, race, gender, and date of birth. The Setting Records file contains information about the type of child care setting, the total amount paid to the provider, and the total number of hours of care received by the child. The Pooling Factor file provides state-level data on the percentage of child care funds that is provided through the CCDF, the federal Head Start region the grantee (state) is in and is monitored by, and the state FIPS code for the grantee.

Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). Other topics include attitudes toward religion, changing roles for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to drug education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Miech, Richard A., Lloyd D.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited and length of stay. The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries. The ITS is also used for reporting to international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada.

The information will allow managers and employees to initiate concrete actions in their own department, and where warranted, across the Public Service. \n\nThe effects of Program Review, government restructuring, increased workload and rapid technological advances have greatly affected federal Public Service employees. Recent studies and reports on specific segments of the federal Public Service had shown that low morale was prevalent among executives and knowledge workers and that many employees felt that workplace conditions were not conducive to confidence in management, job satisfaction and career advancement. Much additional information was required in order to further evaluate these findings and determine how the present workplace structure could be improved to meet the challenges facing it at the turn of the new millennium.\n\nIn 1997, the Clerk of the Privy Council introduced the idea of a voluntary survey of all federal Public Service employees. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) was asked to implement the project. The TBS worked in consultation with other key federal departments to develop a national survey that would gather information from all employees through a common questionnaire. As part of the project, Statistics Canada was asked to participate in the development and to collect and process the data. \n\nThe survey results will be used to develop actions at the level of the department, sector or branch and ultimately at the work unit level. The results would also serve as input to the future corporate management agenda. The survey will provide a baseline against which future progress in renewing the workplace can be measured.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Statistics Canada.

This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Zimbabwe. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his administration's overall performance, to state the most important issues facing the nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the media, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, the inclusiveness of the government, and the identification of causes of conflict and resources that may aid in the resolution of conflict. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities are fair. Societal questions were asked of respondents concerning the meaning of being \"poor\" and \"rich,\" monetary support systems, personal responsibility for success or failure, characteristics used in self-identification, methods for securing food, water, schooling, medical services, news and information, and ease of obtaining assistance for certain services. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether respondent was head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, language used in interview, and type of physical disability, if any. In addition, demographic information pertaining to the interviewer is provided, as well as their response to the interview and observations of the respondent's attitude during the interview and of the interview environment.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Masunungure, Eldred, Michael Bratton, E.

The data about States and Territories' licensing policies, including facility monitoring, enforcement of licensing regulations, and licensing program staffing, were gathered by the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in the 2014 NARA Child Care Licensing Programs and Policies Survey. NARA sent an online survey to all state child care licensing agencies in September 2014.

The principal investigators based their\ndefinition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of\nadditional components: payments in kind valued at market prices,\nagricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market\nprices, the value of food and other direct subsidies, and the imputed\nvalue of housing services. The rural component of this collection\nconsists of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of\nanalysis (Part 1) and a second in which the household is the unit of\nanalysis (Part 2). Individual rural respondents reported on their employment\nstatus, level of education, Communist Party membership, type of\nemployer (e.g., public, private, or foreign), type of economic sector\nin which they were employed, occupation, whether they held a second job,\nretirement status, monthly pension, monthly wage, and other sources of\nincome. Demographic variables include relationship to householder,\ngender, age, and student status. Rural households reported extensively\non the character of the household and residence. Information was\nelicited on type of terrain surrounding the house, geographic\nposition, type of house, and availability of electricity. Also\nreported were sources of household income (e.g., farming, industry,\ngovernment, rents, and interest), taxes paid, value of farm, total\namount and type of cultivated land, financial assets and debts,\nquantity and value of various crops, amount of grain purchased or\nprovided by a collective, use of chemical fertilizers, gasoline, and\noil, quantity and value of agricultural machinery, and all household\nexpenditures (e.g., food, fuel, medicine, education, transportation,\nand electricity). The urban component of this collection also consists\nof two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of analysis (Part 3)\nand a second in which the household is the unit of analysis (Part 4).\nIndividual urban respondents reported on their economic status within\nthe household, Communist Party membership, sex, age, nature of\nemployment, and relationship to the household head. Information was\ncollected on all types and sources of income from each member of the\nhousehold whether working, nonworking, or retired, all revenue\nreceived by owners of private or individual enterprises, and all\nin-kind payments (e.g., food, durable goods, and nondurable goods). Urban\nhouseholds reported total income (including salaries, interest on\nsavings and bonds, dividends, rent, leases, alimony, gifts, and\nboarding fees), all types and values of food subsidies received, and\ntotal debt. Information was also gathered on household accommodations\nand living conditions, including number of rooms, total living area in\nsquare meters, availability and cost of running water, sanitary\nfacilities, heating and air-conditioning equipment, kitchen\navailability, location of residence, ownership of home, and\navailability of electricity and telephone. Households reported on all\ntheir expenditures including amounts spent on food items such as\nwheat, rice, edible oils, pork, beef and mutton, poultry, fish and\nseafood, sugar, and vegetables by means of coupons in state-owned\nstores and at free market prices. Information was also collected on\nrents paid by the households, fuel available, type of transportation\nused, and availability and use of medical and child care.\nThe Chinese Household Income Project collected data in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007.

It was designed to advance the understanding of the\n developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social\n behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways\n of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and\n violence. At the same time, the project provided a detailed look at\n the environments in which these social behaviors took place by\n collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including\n its people, institutions, and resources. Longitudinal\n Cohort Study One component of the PHDCN was the\n Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was a series of coordinated\n longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected\n children, adolescents, and young adults, and their primary caregivers\n over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as\n well as the personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or\n away from a variety of antisocial behaviors. The age cohorts include\n birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years.

Self Report of\n Offending The data in this collection are from Wave 2 of\n the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was administered between 1997 and\n 2000.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in\n the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon\n seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of\n socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically\n meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census\n tracts and geographic boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's\n neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC\n was comprised of approximately 8,000 people. Longitudinal\n Cohort Study For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a\n stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80\n NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by\n three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells\n as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between\n racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were\n chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the\n sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was\n collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and\n young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18\n years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately\n 40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate\n was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that\n qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the\n Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were\n identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,\n 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data collection, and 5,338 were\n interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection. Data collection for\n Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It included a letter sent to\n study participants notifying them that they would be contacted to\n schedule an interview. This letter explained the study,\n reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000 for\n those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A toll\n free number was also included in the letter, so participants could\n call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions. For\n all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the child\n were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to spend\n the most time taking care of the child. Separate research assistants\n administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated\n telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in\n Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived\n outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants\n were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone\n interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of\n the sample. Proxy interviews were conducted with study\n participants who were emancipated minors (under 18 but married or\n living independently). The study participants answered questions from\n the primary caregiver's interview on the primary caregiver's\n behalf. In Wave 2, four primary caregivers and two study participants\n were interviewed in jail. Study participants in foster care could not\n be interviewed. The Department of Children and Family Services did not\n allow interviews of the foster parent or the child. Permission was\n granted for a brief period in Wave 1, therefore there are some\n children in the sample who could not be followed up in Waves 2 and\n 3. Some children were not in foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in\n foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly,\n some participants were interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as\n they were in foster care during Wave 2. Some participants in\n Wave 1 spoke a language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. In\n Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary caregiver's protocol was\n administered, and the research assistant arranged for someone in the\n household to translate on the spot. In Wave 2, the complete protocol\n was translated into Spanish, and a subset of the primary caregiver's\n interview was translated into Polish. Depending on the age and\n wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20 per\n interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the\n aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Self Report of Offending  The Self Report of\n Offending was adapted from the Self-Report of Delinquency\n Questionnaire and the Self-Report of Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire\n to cover ages seven to adulthood. Information about lifetime and past\n year involvement in 35 delinquent and criminal behaviors (including\n theft, assault, and public disorder) was obtained with follow-up\n prompts designed to obtain information about age of onset and date of\n recent involvement as well as other factors such as police involvement\n or solitary versus group offending. Information regarding the\n participant's involvement with the police and court system was also\nobtained.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The data files contain information regarding the\n participant's involvement in various delinquent acts or crimes, such\n as truancy, weapon use, public disorder, arson, theft, fraud, illegal\n drug use, assault, illegal sexual activities, and traffic violations.\n In addition, data were collected regarding the consequences of the\n participant's activities, including information regarding treatment\nprograms, court appearances, and legal outcomes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

The data generated from the responses to the supplement will provide input to determine the rates for quota reductions for qualified employers. Although the Absence from Work Survey collects information on absences from work due to illness, accident or pregnancy, it does not provide a complete picture of people who have been absent from work for these reasons because the concepts and definitions have been developed specifically for the needs of the client. Absences in this survey are defined as being at least two weeks in length, and respondents are only asked the three reasons for their most recent absence and the one preceding it.\n<br>\nThe Absence From Work Survey, 1981, was conducted in 1980, that is, the Reference Year is 1980.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"University of Guelph.

The survey focuses on the health of Canadians aged 45 and over by examining the various factors that impact healthy aging, such as general health and well-being, physical activity, use of health care services, social participation, as well as work and retirement transitions.\n\nPolicy makers, researchers and planners are aware that planning for the future of an aging population is an important activity now and in the coming years. This survey will help them make informed decisions regarding health care, social services and income support programs that will affect all Canadians. \n\nThe specific objectives of the survey are: \n\n1. To better understand the aging process of people aged 45 and over by collecting data on various aspects of their health and well being, use of health care services, social support and participation and work and retirement transitions. \n\n2. To examine how lifestyle determinants affect health as people age.\n\n3. To examine the links among healthy aging and social, demographic, geographic and economic variables or characteristics using a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n4.

Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors\r\n, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.\r\n</p> <p>Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:</p> <ol> <li>The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.</li> <li>There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors for\r\nthis period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.\r\n</li> <li>The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour mark\r\net trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.\r\n</li> </ol> <p>The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.</p>","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Statistics Canada, 2016,

The data file contains variables from the original USMS files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 1.1-1.3. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Identification of protein interactions is a major goal in molecular biology, but biochemical methods, although improving, remain limited in coverage and accuracy. Whereas computational predictions can guide biochemical experiments, low validation rates of  predictions remain a major limitation. Here, we investigated computational methods in the prediction of a specific type of interaction, the inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors. Proteases generate thousands of proteoforms that dynamically shape the functional state of proteomes. Despite the important regulatory role of proteases, knowledge of their inhibitors remains largely incomplete with the vast majority of proteases lacking an annotated inhibitor. To link inhibitors to their target proteases on a large scale, we applied computational methods to predict inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors based on complementary data including coexpression, phylogenetic similarity, structural information, co-annotation, and colocalization, and also surveyed general protein interaction networks for potential inhibitory interactions. In testing nine predicted interactions biochemically, we validated the inhibition of kallikrein 5 by serpin B12. Despite the use of a wide array of complementary data, we found a high false positive rate of computational predictions in biochemical follow-up. Based on a protease-specific definition of true negatives derived from the biochemical classification of proteases and inhibitors, we analyzed prediction accuracy of individual features. Thereby we identified feature-specific limitations, which also affected general protein interaction prediction methods. Interestingly, proteases were often not coexpressed with most of their functional inhibitors, contrary to what is commonly assumed and extrapolated predominantly from cell culture experiments. Predictions of inhibitory interactions were indeed more challenging than predictions of non-proteolytic and non-inhibitory interactions. In summary, we describe a novel and well-defined but difficult protein interaction prediction task, and thereby highlight limitations of computational interaction prediction methods.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Fortelny, Nikolaus; Butler, Georgina; Overall, Christopher; Pavlidis, Paul, 2017, \"Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions\", http://hdl.handle.net/11272/10472 University of British Columbia  [Distributor] V7 [Version]","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Fortelny N, Butler GS, Overall CM, Pavlidis P. \"Protease-Inhibitor Interaction Predictions: Lessons on the Complexity of Protein–Protein Interactions.\" Molecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP. 2017;16(6):1038-1051. doi:10.1074/mcp.M116.065706.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for Blood Research, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for Blood Research, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Fortelny, Nikolaus","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Butler, Georgina","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Overall, Christopher","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Pavlidis, Paul","metadata-type":"element"},{"prodPlac":"Vancouver, BC","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteases","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteinprotein interaction","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteaseinhibitor interaction","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"computational prediction","metadata-type":"element"},{"producer":"Michael Smith Laboratories\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"producer":"University of British Columbia \n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"prodDate":"2017","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2018","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":239,"uri":"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Fodesi%2Flfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"Labour"}," ",{"highlight":"Force"}," ",{"highlight":"Survey"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Canada"},"] [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/subTitl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"Labour"}," ",{"highlight":"Force"}," ",{"highlight":"Survey"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/altTitl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"LFS"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"lfs"},"-",{"highlight":"71M0001XCB"},"-",{"highlight":"E"},"-",{"highlight":"1997"},"-",{"highlight":"march"},"-",{"highlight":"rebased"},"\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:syear","match-text":[{"highlight":"1997"}]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"\n<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1996.

Those who were registered to vote were asked about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus that year, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election and for whom, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location.

After the election, 1,220 adults were re-interviewed in a call-back poll conducted November 7-10, 2008. Respondents who had voted were asked who they had voted for, when they had finally decided on a candidate, the main reason they chose that candidate, which voting method they used, how long they had waited in line to vote, and whether they were contacted by a presidential campaign. Those who did not vote were asked about the main reason they did not vote. All respondents in the call-back poll were asked whether progress had been made against racial discrimination since the 1960s, whether they were pleased with the outcome of the election, and their views on the upcoming Obama presidency. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, length of time at current residence, military service, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News.

The poll was\nconducted a few days before the second anniversary of the September 11,\n2001 terrorist attack. Respondents were asked to give their opinions of\nPresident George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, foreign\npolicy, the economy, the United States campaign against terrorism, and\nthe situation in Iraq. Those polled were asked whether terrorism or the\neconomy was a bigger problem, whether they supported the Bush\nadministration's policy on Iraq and the United States military presence\nthere, whether the number of United States military casualties was\nacceptable, and how well the United States was doing in restoring order\nin Iraq. Specific questions asked whether the war in Iraq was worth\nfighting, whether it was part of or separate from the war against\nterrorism, whether it would decrease terrorism in the long run, and\nwhether it would be a success if Saddam Hussein was not killed or\ncaptured. Respondents were asked to rate the performance of groups,\ninstitutions, and individuals in dealing with the events of September\n11, 2001, and the war on terrorism. They were also asked to evaluate the\njob done by the United States in preventing terrorist attacks, winning\nthe cooperation of other countries in fighting terrorism, breaking up\nthe al Qaeda network, improving United States intelligence, and\nreorganizing government agencies. Questions sought respondent views on\nwhether Osama bin Laden had to be captured or killed in order to win the\nwar on terrorism, and whether other countries had done enough to support\nthe United States campaign against terrorism. Respondents were asked to\ncomment on their feelings about the terrorist attacks of September 11,\n2001, how often they thought about it, whether it changed the United\nStates and the respondent's life, whether the changes were long- or\nshort-term, big or small, positive or negative, if spending time with\nfamily was important to them, how concerned they were about being a\nvictim of a terrorist attack, and how concerned they were about the\npossibility of more terrorist attacks in the United States. A series of\nquestions addressed whether respondents worried about flying because of\nthe risk of terrorism, if the respondent had flown on a commercial\nairplane since September 11, 2001, if airport security was better than\nbefore the attacks, whether security measures were justified, the\nusefulness of the government's threat alert system, and whether the\nUnited States was safer from terrorism than before the attacks. Opinions\nwere also solicited on whether the United States government was doing\nenough to protect the rights of American citizens, Arab-Americans,\nnon-citizens, and terrorist suspects, if the federal government was\nintruding on the respondent's personal privacy rights and whether this\nwas justified, and whether it was more important for the FBI to\ninvestigate possible terrorist threats even if it intruded on personal\nprivacy, or for the FBI not to intrude on personal privacy, even if it\nlimited its ability to investigate possible threats. Respondents were\nalso polled on whether they would support or oppose the federal\ngovernment holding suspected terrorists without trial and using physical\ntorture in an attempt to get information from them. Additional questions\naddressed whether respondents felt they had a good understanding of the\nbeliefs of Islam, whether it taught respect for the beliefs of\nnon-Muslims, and if their opinion of Islam was favorable or unfavorable.\nBackground variables include age, sex, education, ethnicity, religion,\npolitical orientation, political party affiliation, subjective size of\ncommunity, and household income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"ABC News.

The methods used to conduct the surveys varied.\nCommunity surveys (Part 1) were conducted by telephone between August 12, 2008 and October 27, 2008 by the Schaeffer Center for Public Policy at the University of Baltimore. Calling was done through the Schaeffer Center's CATI system. The Schaeffer Center completed 458 telephone surveys with randomly-selected residents of Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering. The brief surveys included questions on opinions of police effectiveness and professionalism. It also queried respondents about neighborhood crime and disorder problems and victimization.\nA total of 312 officer surveys (Part 2) were conducted in Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering in the fall of 2008 and spring of 2009. The officer surveys had three parts: job satisfaction items, procedural knowledge items, and questions about the culture of integrity. The surveys were administered differently in participating sites. In Broward County, the surveys were web-based questionnaires that officers took online. In Kettering and Knoxville, the surveys were administered at roll call sessions for all shifts by project staff. For both modes of administration, officers completed the surveys anonymously.\nBrief telephone surveys were administered between December 2008 and March 2009 to persons who had a recent contact with the law enforcement officers in Dallas, Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering. The voluntary contact surveys (Part 3) were completed by 804 individuals who voluntarily contacted the police department to report a crime while the involuntary contact surveys (Part 4) were completed by 761 adults who were stopped by police in any of the four jurisdictions. Surveys in all four jurisdictions were conducted using lists of persons who had had a recent law enforcement encounter supplied by the participating law enforcement agencies. The voluntary and involuntary contact surveys were conducted by RAND adjunct staff in all areas but Dallas. Due to the large number of respondents in Dallas, the telephone surveys were conducted by the Survey Center at George Mason University.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Part 1 contains 55 variables including police effectiveness, police professionalism, neighborhood problems, and victimization variables.

The results reveal two consistently\nsignificant correlates of human capital growth: population and the\nexisting stock of college-educated labor. Given that population growth\nand human capital growth are both positively associated with\neducation, these results suggest that the geographic distributions of\npopulation and human capital should have become more concentrated in\nrecent decades. That is, larger, more-educated metropolitan areas\nshould have exhibited the fastest rates of increase in both population\nand education and thus 'pulled away' from smaller, less-education\nmetropolitan areas.

Prior to this data collection, there\n were no data available in New Mexico that systematically documented the\n concurrence of substance abuse and domestic violence, even though\n some data sources indicated the prevalence of domestic violence\n in Albuquerque.

At the time of this study's first release,\n the ADAM program was operational in approximately 35 cities nationwide,\n providing national and local profiles of drug use within arrestee\n populations and the monitoring of drug use patterns. An extension and\n refinement of the previous Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program (see DRUG\n USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 [ICPSR\n 9477]), the ADAM program (see ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM)\n PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1999 [ICPSR 2994)], 2000 [ICPSR 3270], and\n 2001 [ICPSR 3688]) is the United States government's primary source of\n information on drug use among arrestees, and is one of the primary\n research tools on drug use, crime, and other social indicators.\n Quarterly interviews with arrestees selected using probability-based\n (for males) and convenience sampling (for females) were conducted in\n jails and detention facilities at each ADAM site. Urine samples were\n also collected and tested for a core panel of drugs that included\n cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and opiates. Because the drug screen\n could not detect drugs beyond 72 hours after use, only arrestees who had\n been incarcerated 48 hours or less were eligible for participation. The\n ADAM interview provided demographic and descriptive data including race,\n age, marital status, source of income, screens for substance abuse and\n dependency, treatment history, arrest and incarceration experiences, and\n participation in local drug markets. At the conclusion of the ADAM\n interview, respondents were asked to provide a urine specimen that was\n used to corroborate self-reports of recent drug use. After the ADAM\n interview and urine collection process were completed, the respondent\n was presented with the option of participating in the domestic violence\n study. Permission to be interviewed was obtained from the arrestee.\n Research staff defined a partner as a person with whom the respondent\n had an intimate, romantic, or sexual relationship, whether they lived\n together or not. They included both same-sex and opposite sex intimate\n partners in the definition and used the terms intimate partner violence\n and domestic violence interchangeably as defined in New Mexico statutes.\n Originally, researchers wanted to interview only those offenders brought\n in on domestic violence charges. However, the ADAM protocol would not\n accommodate this arrangement, and the collection of domestic violence\n data was predicated on the ADAM sampling strategy. Since all Bernalillo\n County arrestees were included in the sample frame, interviews could not\n be limited to domestic violence offenders. Therefore, the research staff\n adapted their domestic violence instrument to focus the respondent's\n attention on the most recent incident of domestic violence. The design\n of the domestic violence instrument mandated that all respondents were\n asked questions influenced by and based, in part, on the Conflict Tactic\n Scale. Several methodological and logistical issues affected the\n research efforts. Difficulties resulted from changes in the ADAM\n instrument (with a new instrument implemented in 2000), shifts in\n national sample collection protocol, jail facility staffing shortages,\n and the merging of data sources. Users are strongly encouraged to obtain\n the final report for this study, which extensively details each of these\n issues. The research staff want users to be aware that self-reports of\n race/ethnicity reflect an over- representation of minorities among\n Albuquerque's arrestee population. Therefore, it is difficult to compare\n Albuquerque's 2000 United States census figures to ADAM data due to the\n differing treatment of terms such as \"race\" and \"ethnicity.\" Standard\n ADAM procedures required four quarters of data collection throughout the\n calendar year. Each collection period, conducted once during a three\n month period, was 14 consecutive days, with each collection day lasting\n eight hours. The data in this collection are based upon survey results\n from ADAM data collected during the third and fourth quarters of 1999,\n the first, second, and third quarters of 2000, and the first quarter of\n2001.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Demographic variables taken from the ADAM data\n collection include respondent's age, gender, race, ethnicity, residency,\n education, employment, and marital status. Other variables include the\n three most serious arrest charges, heavy alcohol use, use of marijuana,\n crack/rock cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other\n drugs (ever and previous 12 months), age of first use of the above six\n drugs and heavy alcohol use, and drug dependency in the previous 12\n months. Demographic variables from the domestic violence survey addendum\n include the sex, age, race, and religious affiliation of the intimate\n partner. Other variables from the domestic violence survey include\n whether the respondent slapped, threw objects at, pushed, grabbed,\n choked, stabbed, shot, or threatened to harm the intimate partner and\n whether any of these actions were attempted by the intimate partner in\n response to the respondent. The frequencies of these specific events\n within a 12-month and 30-day period are included. Respondents also\n indicated whether they sustained or caused injuries such as a black eye,\n bloody lip, deep cuts, burns, chipped or knocked out teeth,\n miscarriages, or irritated or bleeding genitals. Respondents also\n described the most recent physical injury involving their intimate\n partner, the reason for the injury, whether alcohol or illegal drugs\n influenced the incident, and if so, which drugs were involved.

The collateral informants were nominated by the main study participant and represented individuals who \"knew the study participant well\". At the interview baseline the collateral informant was usually a biological parent. During the three follow-up interviews the majority of collaterals were a friend. Collateral informants could also be a sibling, significant other, or relative. Collaterals were asked questions in regards to the main study participant's life, allowing for comparison between responses provided by two sources. A baseline interview was conducted with the collateral after the baseline interview took place with the main participant. Additional waves of follow-up with collaterals took place at 12, 24, and 36 months. A collateral report is not present for all of the main study participant interviews across waves (see response rate below).\nThe current Collateral Measures study primarily consists of the calculated scores from constructs asked about during the interview, but the individual scale items were withheld at that time. These additional datasets contain those individual items plus the calculated scores.

The three dockets were established in 1992 for the purpose\n of expediting the handling of drug cases. This study was undertaken to\n measure the impact of the standard, treatment, and sanction dockets on\n drug-involved defendants in Washington, DC, while examining\n defendants' continued drug use, criminal activity, and social and\n economic functioning. Features common to all three dockets of the\n SCDIP program included early intervention, frequent drug testing, and\n judicial involvement in monitoring drug test results, as well as the\n monitoring of each defendant's progress. Each docket offered different\n services as follows: (1) The standard docket continued to handle drug\n cases in a routine manner, which included twice-weekly drug tests and\n judicial monitoring of the results. Current computerized drug test\n information was available at the judge's bench at each hearing. The\n standard docket judges typically encouraged defendants who tested\n positive or missed tests to seek treatment but did not provide case\n management staff to assist them and did not levy sanctions for test\n failures. (2) The treatment docket provided a comprehensive day\n treatment program designed to provide the skills, self-esteem, and\n community resources necessary to help drug-dependent individuals leave\n the drug-using criminal life. The treatment docket included more\n frequent drug testing -- daily or three times per week. Penalties\n were imposed by the treatment staff for nonattendance, tardiness, and\n behavior problems in treatment, but not for positive drug tests, which\n were handled by judges. Judicial admonishment and program termination\n were used to respond to persistent, serious problems. Participants\n were expected to move through sequential treatment stages, which\n consisted of an orientation phase and a five-level intensive treatment\n phase. Progression through the program was contingent upon the\n participant's progress toward the treatment objectives outlined in the\n treatment plan, which included academic functioning, participation,\n and social adjustment. (3) The sanction docket offered eligible\n defendants (who successfully completed the program) the opportunity\n for an increased chance of receiving probation rather than\n incarceration at sentencing. This docket offered drug-involved\n defendants a program that required twice weekly drug testing,\n referrals to community-based treatment, and graduated sanctions for\n drug test failures. Failure to appear and test drug free twice each\n week resulted in the swift and certain applications of clearly defined\n penalties at compliance hearings. Penalties increased in severity with\n each drug test failure. Because the court wanted the consequences of a\n bad test outcome clearly understood by the defendants and all\n concerned, the type of penalty was the same for a missed test,\ntampered sample, or positive test.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Data for this study were collected from four\n sources for defendants arrested on drug felony charges between\n September 1, 1994, and January 31, 1996, who had been randomly\n assigned to one of three drug dockets (sanction, treatment, or\n standard) as part of the Washington, DC, Superior Court Drug\n Program.

The 2000 NSGVP was conducted by Statistics Canada in October, November and early December of 2000 on behalf of the Voluntary Sector Initiative and in partnership with federal policy departments and voluntary organizations. The content of the 2000 NSGVP and its methodology are, for the most part,identical to that of the 1997 Survey. The 2000 survey is based on a representative sample of 14,724 Canadians aged 15 and over who were asked how they gave money and other resources to individuals and to organizations, volunteered time to help others and to enhance their communities, and participated in the practices of active citizenship. The survey, given its scale, provides the most comprehensive assessment of giving, volunteering and participating ever undertaken in Canada or, to the best of our knowledge, in the world. The 2000 survey replicates the 1997 survey and enables us to begin to track both changes in contributory behaviours and changes in the characteristics of those Canadians making contributions. Any trend in these behaviours has important implications for Canadian society. The results from the survey allow this report to paint a portrait of the ways Canadians contribute to society through their monetary and voluntary support of others. Charitable giving encompasses the following types of charitable giving which were measured in this survey: cash donations, in-kind donations and indirect financial support.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"University of Guelph.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories.</p>\n\n<p>Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note importante</strong> : Étant donné que les valeurs manquantes n'apparaissent pas dans ces ensembles de données, toute forme de non-réponse (e.g. saut valide, indéterminé) ou ne sais pas/refus ne peuvent pas être codées comme manquantes.

The original purpose of\nthe survey was to study employment patterns among men in their 40s and\n50s who were on the verge of making decisions about the timing and\nextent of their withdrawal from the labor force and their plans for\nretirement. The survey was first administered to 5,020 respondents by\ninterviewers from the United States Census Bureau in 1966. The survey\nwas repeated a further 12 times between the years of 1967 and 1983. An\nadditional version of the survey was completed by living respondents\nor by the widows or other family members of deceased respondents in\n1990, and afterward it was discontinued. The survey queried\nrespondents on 14 main subjects: labor market experiences,\nwork-related discrimination, training investments, schooling\ninformation, military experiences, retirement plans and experiences,\nvolunteer work and leisure-time activities, income and assets,\nphysical well-being, health care and health insurance, alcohol and\ncigarette use, attitudes, aspirations, and psychological well-being.\nAlso collected were geographic and environmental data, demographic and\nfamily background data, marital history, and number of children and\ndependents. An important portion of the survey was dedicated to the\nrespondent's labor market experiences. Respondents were asked to\nprovide information regarding their occupation, their working class,\nhours worked per week, rate of pay, and attitude toward their current\njob. Respondents were also asked about a variety of job-related\nactivities including shift worked, union membership, length of\ncommute, tenure, employment benefits, and eligibility for retirement\nbenefits. Respondents who were unemployed or temporarily out of the\nlabor force were asked about their plans for seeking employment,\nnumber of weeks spent looking for work, number of weeks spent out of\nthe labor force, and reasons for not seeking employment. Respondents\nwere also asked about work-related discrimination. Specifically,\nthere were questions aimed at determining whether the respondent had\never experienced discrimination based on age, race, religion, or\ngender. Respondents also were asked about training experiences. The\nsurvey included questions about vocational training completed in high\nschool, enrollment in business or technical training programs, armed\nforces training programs, and other types of apprenticeships and\ntraining programs in which the respondent had participated upon\ncompletion of his regular schooling. Additional questions regarding\ntraining courses or educational programs completed on the job were\nalso included. Respondents were asked to provide information on their\neducational status and attainment including highest grade completed,\nthe last year the respondents attended college, whether they earned a\ndegree, and the highest college degree attained. The data also contain\ninformation on the respondents' military service record, general\nperiods of service, start and stop dates for periods of active duty,\nand income from armed forces pension plans. Retirement was another\nmajor theme addressed by the survey. Respondents were asked about\nretirement plans and expectations such as what age they expected to\nretire, what sorts of activities they planned to be involved with\nafter retiring, eligibility for Social Security benefits, and expected\nincome during retirement. Some surveys asked respondents what sorts of\nleisure activities they had participated in during the previous\nyear. There were also questions regarding family assets and debts.\nSpecifically, respondents were asked whether they or their spouses\nowned their own homes, other real estate, or automobiles, and the\ntotal worth of those assets. Respondents were also asked about other\nassets such as savings accounts, United States savings bonds, other\nbonds, stocks, and any personal loans. Respondents were asked to rate\ntheir overall health condition and their general satisfaction with\ntheir health. In addition, respondents were asked if they had\nexperienced any of a variety of health-related problems including\npain, fatigue, weakness, fainting spells, anxiety or depression, or\nshortness of breath. Alcohol and cigarette consumption during the\npast 12 months was also covered. The survey included a series of\nquestions targeting respondents' attitudes, aspirations, and overall\npsychological well-being. Several geographic variables were included\nin the data, specifically place of residence including Census\ndivision, South or non-South differentiation, and residence in a\nmetropolitan statistical area. Other geographic variables include data\non the respondents' previous places of residence as well as\ncharacteristics about the size of the labor force and unemployment\nrates for their current residence. In addition, there are several\ndemographic variables including the respondents' race, nationality,\ndate of birth, birthplace, and parents' educational and life\nstatus. There are also variables relating to marital status,\nchildren, and dependents. They include current marital status, dates,\nduration, and reason for the end of previous marriages, total number\nof children, number of children living at home, ages of children,\ndates of birth, and gender of children.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Ohio State University.

Specific\nquestions asked whether the war with Iraq was worth fighting, if it was\nseparate from or part of the war on terrorism, whether the number of\nmilitary casualties was acceptable or unacceptable, whether respondents\nwould support or oppose Congress spending an additional 87 billion\ndollars for the war and rebuilding of Iraq, and whether it was more\nimportant to keep United States military forces in Iraq until civil\norder could be restored or to withdraw forces to avoid further military\ncasualties. Questions were posed regarding how closely respondents\nfollowed the 2004 presidential election, whether they would vote for\nGeorge W. Bush or a Democratic nominee for president, how likely they\nwere to vote, whether the Republican and Democratic parties were being\nled in the right direction, how closely each party reflected the\nrespondents' beliefs on important issues, whether the Democratic Party\nwas too willing or not willing enough to compromise with President Bush,\nand whether there should be more than two major political parties.\nDemocratic-leaning respondents were asked whom they would vote for in\nthe Democratic presidential primary (Senator Joe Lieberman, United\nStates Representative Dick Gephardt, Senator John Kerry, Senator John\nEdwards, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, former Vermont governor\nHoward Dean, United States Representative Dennis Kucinich, former\nSenator Carol Moseley Braun, or General Wesley Clark), how satisfied\nthey were with the choice of Democratic nominees, which candidate had\nthe best chance of defeating Bush, and whether respondents preferred a\ncandidate who agreed with them on most issues or one who would have an\neasier time defeating Bush.

At the time the experiment was going into the field, Indianapolis was experimenting with two different types of lever-pulling meeting: one where probationers were assigned to face-to-face meetings with federal, state, and local law enforcement officials who focused primarily on a deterrence-based message (similar to the Boston lever-pulling meeting)\nand the second where probationers attended meetings with community leaders and service providers who focused solely on a compliance message and available community services. Accordingly, probationers were randomly assigned to attend one of these two types of meetings and were compared to a control group of probationers who were on regular\nprobation supervision. Specifically, probationers were randomly assigned to the law enforcement focused lever-pulling group (Group 1), the community leader lever-pulling group (Group 2), or a regular probation control group (Group 3) during six months between June 2003 and March 2004 (June/July, September/October, February/March). All felony probationers convicted of thirteen violent, drug, gun, and property offenses were eligible for random selection. There were a total of 540 probationers in the study--180 probationers in each group.\nProbationers in the law enforcement focused lever-pulling group had face-to-face meetings with federal and local law enforcement officials and primarily received a deterrence-based message, but community officials also discussed various types of job and treatment opportunities. Specifically, the law enforcement lever-pulling meeting occurred at the courthouse. A total of twenty to thirty probationers and an equal number of criminal justice practitioners and community officials attended these meetings. The overall message included concern about violence in the community, the consequences that probationers would face if they committed violent acts, and the opportunities that were being made available to them (i.e., \"carrots and sticks.\") Most of the speakers stressed how their organization would\nrespond to continued involvement in crime by \"pulling all levers\" if they decided to be involved in criminal activities. The community speakers (and to a lesser extent one or two law enforcement officials) talked specifically about programs and opportunities.\nIn contrast, probationers in the community leader lever-pulling group attended meetings with community leaders and service providers who exclusively focused on the impact of violence on the community and available services. The community leader lever-pulling meeting occurred at a community center. A total of three to five well known community leaders spoke at the meeting about their concern for violence in the community, program and treatment opportunities, and faith-based services.\nThis project provided a process oriented account of lever\npulling in action. This allowed for the documentation of how lever pulling was implemented during the study period, allowed for the documentation of the treatment regiment, and allowed for the determination of whether the experiment, and the treatment, were\nimplemented as designed. A total of three types of data were collected to assess perceptions about the meeting: Offending behavior, program participation behavior, and the levers pulled. First, data were collected using a self-report survey instrument (Part 1). Computer-assisted interviews via laptop computer were completed approximately seven months after being assigned to a group. A total of three types of data were collected with this interview instrument: Meeting evaluation and perception of risk, self-reported offense and gun use behavior, and demographics. Second, the complete criminal history for probationers (Part 2) was collected one year after their meeting date. These data provided a good sense of each probationer's complete offending history, but also their criminal activities after the treatment for one year. Third, all available probation data (Part 3) were collected 365 days after the meeting date. Data were collected by recording information from the official probation records and coding the probation case notes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Part 1, Self-Report Survey Data, includes a total of 316 variables related to the following three types of data: Section I: meeting evaluation and perception of risk, Section II: Self-reported offense and gun use behavior, and Section III: Demographics. Section I of the survey focused on gathering information about the meetings, the law enforcement response, whether they have used the community resources made available to them, and what types of behavioral changes have occurred. This section also collected information about their perceptions of risk of arrest, conviction, and sanction, and gathered their impressions of the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. Section II included questions about attitudes towards gun use, self-report criminal activities, gang, and criminal history data. A series of questions about different types of offenses (guns, drugs, nonviolent, violent crime) were asked, including whether they committed the type of offense, how often if they did, and used a variation of the event calendar approach to more closely examine frequency of occurrence. Section III gathered demographic data. Data on year born, education, race, marital status, employment, and income status were collected.\nPart 2, Criminal History Data, includes a total of 94 variables collected about the probationer's complete offending history as well as their criminal activities after the treatment for one year. Data include the number of arrests, arrest charges, felony and misdemeanor classification, convictions, and post-treatment sentencing decisions. Sentencing data were also collected, including number of times on probation, jail, prison, and the length of various types of sentence. In addition, the researchers also calculated time-to-failure (number of days from lever pulling meeting to first arrest).\nPart 3, Probation Data, includes a total of 249 variables related to probation history and other outcome data. The variables measured the respondents' general probation behavior as well as their behavior on probation following the treatment meetings. Data include demographic information, and variables pertaining to probation status, meeting attendance, employment information, residence information, program related concerns, and information about any contacts or responses to violations. The data include variables with information about their participation and behavior in various types of programs. In addition, variables measure the number and types of levers pulled. Other variables include the number of urine screens ordered, results of the screen, and response to positive screens, number of administrative hearings, reasons for the hearings, and response, and number of revocation hearings, reasons for the hearing, and response. The researchers also collected information about the number of meetings, telephone contacts, home visits, work visits, and the number of times probationers were involved in probation sweeps.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Chermak, Steven M.

For each of the scenarios, data are available for persons who identify with each of the following three groups: the North American Indian population, the Métis or the Inuit. \n<br>\nAll three groups were projected separately for each of the ten provinces and three territories. However, the subprovincial and subterritorial level shown for the three groups varies as it depends on the groups' size. For the North American Indians, future numbers were calculated for the urban parts of all census metropolitan areas (CMAs), urban areas outside CMAs, rural areas and reserves. For the Métis, places of residence were grouped into urban parts of CMAs, urban areas outside CMAs and rural areas, which also include reserves. Because of their relatively small size, the Inuit population was projected separately for urban and rural locations only. This information is further broken down by age and sex.\n<br>\nThe 18 scenarios, as well as scenario-specific assumptions on the future trend in fertility and internal migration, are presented in the table below.  In addition to these two components of population growth, all scenarios assumed declining mortality and negligible importance of international migration to the change of the size of three Aboriginal groups.\n<br>\nThe statistical tables of this CD-ROM are organized into three sections:\n<br>\n1 - Aboriginal groups - The projected population by Aboriginal group, type of residence, province/territory and sex for the 18 scenarios by single year from 2001 to 2017;\n<br>\n2 - Age and sex - The projected population by Aboriginal group, type of residence, age group and sex for the 18 scenarios by single year from 2001 to 2017; and\n<br>\n3 - Province/territory - The projected total Aboriginal population by province/territory, age group, sex and type of residence for the 18 scenarios for 2001 and 2017.\n<br>\nThe statistical tables are supplementary to the publication Projections of the Aboriginal populations, Canada, provinces and territories: 2001 to 2017 (catalogue no. 91-547).\n<p>For current population projections for Canada, provinces, and territories data refer to <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/surveys/3602\" target=\"_blank\">Statistics Canada</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://odesi.scholarsportal.info/documentation/DEMOG/APS/PROJ01_17/DOCS/aps-tables_ag.html\" target=\"_blank\">Access data by All-Aboriginal Groups here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://odesi.scholarsportal.info/documentation/DEMOG/APS/PROJ01_17/DOCS/aps-tables_as.html\" target=\"_blank\">Access data by Age and Sex here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://odesi.scholarsportal.info/documentation/DEMOG/APS/PROJ01_17/DOCS/aps-tables_pt.html\" target=\"_blank\">Access data by Provinces and Territories here</a></p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"University of Guelph.

We report the presence of fishes (Kryptolebias marmoratus, Poecilia orri, Gambusia sp., and Dormitator maculatus) in Belizean mangrove pools with extremely high H2S concentrations (up to 1,166 mM) that would be lethal for most fishes. Thus, we asked whether the three most prevalent species (Kryptolebias, Poecilia, and Gambusia) persist in sulfidic pools because they are exceptionally H2S tolerant and/or because they can leave water (emerse) and completely avoid H2S. We show that both physiological tolerance and emersion behavior are important. Kryptolebias demonstrated high H2S tolerance, as they lost equilibrium significantly later than Poecilia and Gambusia during H2S exposure (1,188 +/- 21 mM H2S). However, the fact that all species lost equilibrium at an ecologically relevant [H2S] suggests that physiological tolerance may suffice at moderate H2S concentrations but that another strategy is required to endure higher concentrations. In support of the avoidance behavior hypothesis, H2S elicited an emersion response in all species. Kryptolebias was most sensitive to H2S and emersed at H2S concentrations 52% and 34% lower than Poecilia and Gambusia, respectively. Moreover, H2 Sexposure caused ﻿Kryptolebias to emerse more frequently and spend more time out ofwater compared to control conditions. We suggest that physiological H2S tolerance and emersion behavior are complementary strategies. The superior H2S tolerance and amphibious capability of Kryptolebias may explain why this species was more prevalent in H2S-rich environments than other local fishes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Rossi, Giulia S.; Tunnah, Louise; Martin, Keri E.; Turko, Andy J.; Taylor, D.

To this end, data were collected on a large percent of the oldest population, including centenarian and nonagenarian; the CLHLS provides information on the health, socioeconomic characteristics, family, lifestyle, and demographic profile of this aged population. Data are provided on respondents' health conditions, daily functioning, self-perceptions of health status and quality of life, life satisfaction, mental attitude, and feelings about aging. \nRespondents were asked about their diet and nutrition, use of medical services, and drinking and smoking habits, including how long ago they quit either or both. They were also asked about their physical activities, reading habits, television viewing, and religious activities, and were tested for motor skills, memory, and visual functioning. In order to ascertain their current state of health, respondents were asked if they suffered from such health conditions as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, emphysema, asthma, tuberculosis, cataracts, glaucoma, gastric or duodenal ulcer, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, bedsores, or other chronic diseases. Respondents were further queried about assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, or feeding, and who provided help in times of illness. Other questions focused on siblings, parents, and children, the frequency of family visits, and the distance lived from each other. Demographic and background variables include age, sex, ethnicity, place of birth, marital history and status, history of childbirth, living arrangements, education, main occupation before age 60, and sources of financial support.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Zeng, Yi, James Vaupel, Zhenyu Xiao, Yuzhi Liu, and Chunyuan Zhang.

These surveys have been done as supplements to the Canadian Labour Force Survey and as Random Digit Dialling telephone surveys.</p>\n\n<p>In February 1994, a change in legislation was passed which allowed a reduction in cigarette taxes. Since there was no survey data from immediately before this legislative change took place, it was difficult for Health Canada or other interested analysts to measure exactly the impact of the change. As Health Canada wants to be able to monitor the consequences of legislative changes and anti-smoking policies on smoking behaviour, the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey was designed to provide Health Canada and its partners/stakeholders with continual and reliable data on tobacco use and related issues.</p>\n<br><br>\nSince 1999, two CTUMS files have been released every year: a file with data collected from February to June and a file with the July to December data. Additionally, there is also a yearly summary. \n<br><br>\nThe survey is presented in three cycles: Cycle 1 - taken Feb-June 2002; Cycle 2 - taken July-Dec 2002; and Cycle Annual - combining both time periods. Each cycle contains two files; household data, and person data.\n<br><br>\nThe primary objective of the survey is to provide a continuous supply of smoking prevalence data against which changes in prevalence can be monitored. This objective differs from that of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) which collects smoking data from a longitudinal sample to measure which individuals are changing their smoking behaviour, the possible factors which contribute to change, and the possible risk factors related to starting smoking and smoking duration. Because the NPHS collects data every two years and releases the data about a year after completing the collection cycle, it does not meet Health Canada’s need for continuous coverage in time, rapid delivery of data, or sufficient detail of the most at-risk populations, namely 15-24 year olds.\n<br><br>\nThe Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey allows Health Canada to look at smoking prevalence by province-sex-age group, for age groups 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44 and 45+ on a semi-annual basis. The data included in these files represent data collected for the first six months of 2002. Data will continue to be collected on an on-going basis depending on availability of funds.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nCooper, Alexandra. 2014.

This public opinion study of the United States focused on respondents' opinions of the United States' leadership role in the world and the challenges the country faces domestically and internationally.\nData were collected on a wide range of international topics, including: United States' relations with other countries, role in foreign affairs, possible threats to vital interests in the next ten years, foreign policy goals, situations that might justify the use of United States troops in other parts of the world, international trade, United States' participation in potential treaties, U.S. policy towards Russia in Ukraine, the embargo on Cuba and the effects of renewed diplomatic relations with Havana, views of the nuclear deal with Iran and what effects that deal is likely to have, and United States' relations with allies in Asia.\nRespondents were also asked their opinion on domestic issues including climate change, measures to improve the United States' economic competitiveness, and their views on US immigration policy.\nDemographic information collected includes age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, left-right political self-placement, political affiliation, employment status, highest level of education, and religious preference, household income, state of residence, and living quarters ownership status.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes and perceptions of adult Americans across a range of domestic and international public policy issues.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Kafura, Craig, Dina Smeltz, Karl Friedhoff, Ivo Daalder, Gregory Holyk, and Joshua Busby. 2015 Chicago Council Survey of American Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy.

The MSHS Study was designed to closely match the characteristics of the whole population of MSHS programs, centers, families, and children across the United States (a \"nationally representative study\"). Since the last nationally representative study of MSHS was conducted almost 20 years ago, this study provided an update on MSHS programs and centers, as well as the migrant and seasonal farmworker families they serve.\nThe MSHS Study included data from programs and centers (collected from surveys of program and center directors), classrooms (collected through classroom observations and from surveys of teachers and assistant teachers), families (collected from interviews with parents), and children (collected from direct assessments, assessor ratings, and parent and teacher ratings of children). Although the study gathered a range of program, practice, and family information, a central theme of the data collection focused on language practice and the language skills and abilities of the children served. The study examined the following research questions:\nWhat are the characteristics of MSHS programs, centers, staff, families, and children?\nWhat services does MSHS provide, and what are the instructional practices and general classroom quality of MSHS classrooms?\nWhat are the associations between MSHS characteristics and child/family well-being?\nThe MSHS Study methodology, sample, and measures were all developed (or selected) in collaboration with MSHS stakeholders and experts in MSHS programs and early childhood research. The study was conducted by Abt Associates and its partners - the Catholic University of America and Westat - under contract to the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThis collection is organized into 18 data parts:\n4 files with data from MSHS staff surveys, including surveys with program directors (DS2), center directors (DS4), teachers (DS7), and assistant teachers (DS8). All staff surveys collected information on the respondent's background and experience and then focused on questions relevant to each respondent. For example, the Program Director Survey collected information on issues such as enrollment, program policies, and approaches to hiring, communication, and supervision. The Center Director Survey focused on characteristics of the center, such as staffing, enrollment, family engagement, and instructional practices. The Teacher and Assistant Teacher Surveys gathered information on topics at the classroom level, such as classroom composition and language(s) of instruction, and also included the 12-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.\n1 file with data from classroom observations (DS6), including items from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Pre-K, Early Language and Literacy Classroom Observation-Dual Language Learners (ELLCO-DLL), and the MSHS Cultural Items and Language Use (CILU) Checklist.\n5 direct child assessments, including height and weight measurements (DS10), the Leiter-3 Examiner Rating Scale (DS11), the Preschool Language Scales Fifth Edition (PLS-5) - English (DS12), the PLS-5 - Bilingual (DS13), and the Woodcock Muñoz Language Survey (DS14).\n1 file with data from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (DS15) completed by teachers for infants and young children to assess children's nonverbal and verbal communication skills.\n1 file for Teacher Report of Child (DS16), including data from children's language dominance and proficiency, questions about delays and disabilities, the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI-English)/Inventario del Desarrollo de Habilidades Comunicativas (IDHC-Spanish), Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS)-Birth Cohort questions on counting in English and Spanish, and ECLS-Kindergarten Approaches to Learning.\n1 file for Parent Report of Child (DS17), including data from the MacArthur-Bates CDI-English/IDHC-Spanish, Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, and the ECLS-B Socioemotional Scale.\n1 file with data from the Parent Interview (DS18) that focused on characteristics of the household and focal child.

Specifically,\nA Community Consultant Group made up of program directors collaborated with the study team to discuss recruitment plans for data collection, and to promote the MSHS Study in their programs and centers and with their MSHS families.\nTo engage MSHS programs and centers, the study team distributed bilingual newsletters to update programs and centers on study activities. They also released a video that programs and centers could use with their staff to let them know about the study's objectives and background.\nDuring the study planning phase, the study team attended the National Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Association Conference, where they presented on the study to program and center directors and parents in attendance and held informal discussions with program leadership.\nThroughout the study itself, the team worked closely with federal MSHS staff, who provided input and guidance.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Caswell, Linda, Erin Bumgarner, Sandra Barrueco, Michael López, Anne Wolf, Carolyn Layzer, Babette Gutmann, Sylvia Segovia, and Pam Broene.

First, a statewide integrated data system was used to examine impacts of incarceration in a novel way, using administrative data from corrections, juvenile justice, mental health, social services, substance use services, healthcare, and education. Second, researchers linked multi-agency data to address specific research questions regarding impact of incarceration on families, including impact of incarceration on family physical and mental health, children's involvement with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, family economic status, and school performance.

Price change is measured from the perspective of the seller. About 10,000 PPIs for individual products and groups of products are released each month.\nThe PPI universe consists of the output of all industries in the goods-producing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and forestry--as well as the output of the natural gas, electricity, and construction industries. Recycled goods that compete with those made in the goods-producing sectors, such as waste and scrap materials, also are outputs that are part of the survey. Imports are not included within the PPI universe; however, goods shipped between establishments owned by the same company (termed interplant or intracompany transfers) are included, as is a substantial percentage of the domestic production of goods specifically made for the military. The output of the services sector and other sectors that do not produce physical products also is conceptually within the PPI universe.\nThe PPI program covers approximately 72 percent of the service sector's output, as measured by revenue reported in the 2012 Economic Census, and collects data for selected industries in the following sectors: wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance and insurance; real estate brokering, rental, and leasing; professional, scientific, and technical services; administrative, support, and waste management services; health care and social assistance; and accommodation.\nThere are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company survey respondents:\n-Industry classification. A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices received for the industry's output sold outside the industry (that is, its net output). \n-Commodity classification. The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. \n-Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have undergone. \n<b>An overview of the survey can be found in the BLS Handbook of Methods at:  https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/ppi-20111028.pdf </b>","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

In 2011, TSRC underwent a redesign. Please refer to the document entitled Differences Between the 2011 Redesigned TSRC and the 2010 TSRC available in the \"Documentation\" section of this survey, for an explanation of the differences between TSRC from 2006-2010 and TSRC in 2011.</p>\n<p>\nThe Travel Survey of Residents of Canada is sponsored by Statistics Canada, the Canadian Tourism Commission, and the provincial governments.

The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:</p>\n<p>\n- total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada, \n- same-day and overnight visits in Canada,\n- main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip,\n- spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure,\n- modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip,\n- person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada, \n- person- and household-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used,\n- use of travel packages and associated spending and source of payment (household, government, private employer),\n- demographics of adults that took or did not take trips, and\n- travel party composition.</p>\n<p>\nThe main users of the TSRC data are Statistics Canada, the Canadian Tourism Commission, the provinces, and tourism boards.

The election studies are\ndesigned to present data on Americans' social backgrounds, enduring\npolitical predispositions, social and political values, perceptions\nand evaluations of groups and candidates, opinions on questions of\npublic policy, and participation in political life. The 1992 National\nElection Study entailed both a pre-election interview and a\npost-election reinterview. Approximately half of the 1992 cases are\ncomprised of empaneled respondents who were first interviewed in\nAMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1990: POST-ELECTION SURVEY (ICPSR\n9548) and later in AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY: 1990-1991 PANEL\nSTUDY OF THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF WAR/1991 PILOT STUDY (ICPSR\n9673). The other half of the cases are a freshly drawn cross-section\nsample. The panel component of the study design provides an\nopportunity to trace how the changing fortunes of the Bush presidency,\nfrom the high levels of approval at the start of the Gulf War through\nthe decline after the onset of a recession, affected voting in the\nNovember 1992 presidential election. It also permits analysts to\ninvestigate the origins of the Clinton and Perot coalitions as well as\nchanges in the public's political preferences over the two years\npreceding the 1992 election. In the 1990 Post-Election Survey two\nforms of the survey instrument were used, with about 75 percent of the\ncontent being the same on both forms. Survey questions included the\nnow-standard National Election Studies battery of questions, along\nwith items on presidential performance and the Persian Gulf\nconflict. Additionally, Form A contained questions relating to values\nand individualism, while Form B had content relating to foreign\nrelations. In 1991, respondents were reinterviewed several months\nafter hostilities in the Persian Gulf ended, and in this second wave\nthe survey content consisted of a repeat of a subset of questions from\nthe 1990 Post-Election Survey, along with additional items especially\nrelevant to the Gulf War. A number of contextual variables also are\nprovided, including summary variables that combine the respondent's\nrecall of his or her senator's and representative's vote on the use of\nforce with that congressperson's actual vote. The content for the 1992\nElection Study reflects its dual purpose, both as the traditional\npresidential election year time-series data collection and as the\nthird wave of a panel study. In addition to the standard or core\ncontent items, respondents were asked their positions on social issues\nsuch as altruism, abortion, the death penalty, prayer in the schools,\nthe rights of homosexuals, sexual harassment, women's rights, and\nfeminist consciousness. Other substantive themes included racial and\nethnic stereotypes, opinions on school integration and affirmative\naction, attitudes toward immigrants (particularly Hispanics and\nAsians), opinions on immigration policy and bilingual education,\nassessments of United States foreign policy goals, and United States\ninvolvement in the Persian Gulf War. Part 2, the Nonresponse \"Bias\"\nFile, designed to permit analysis of the causes and consequences of\nnonresponse, presents information concerning 3,690 cases that include\ncomplete or partial interviews for the Pre-/Post-Election Survey plus\nrefusals, no-contact, and nonsample cases.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Miller, Warren E., Donald R.

The three countries with firms represented in the\nstudy were national political economies characterized by different\ndegrees of industrialization and hence different configurations of\nsociopolitical forces. They were also relatively politically stable\nduring the five-year period before the survey, thereby implying a\ngreater measure of continuity in the application of Decision 24 than\nwas observed in the other Andean Group countries of Chile and Bolivia,\nor Venezuela, which did not join the Andean Group until 1973. Also,\nbecause of the application of Law 444 in Colombia and the General Law\nof Industries and ITINTEC in Peru, it was anticipated that managers in\nthose two countries would be more conscious of the range of choice\navailable in the selection of technology and that firms would have\nrecently begun to increase the level of in-house R&amp;D activities. The\nchemical and metalworking industries fell within the ambit of Andean\nindustrial programming activities, so managers in those industries\nwere expected to represent a group of relatively well-informed persons\nwith respect to Andean Group issues. The data were obtained from an\norally administered, primarily open-ended questionnaire given to\nmanagers of the selected firms.

This database was originally collected by the Pinkerton Corporation's Global Intelligence Service (PGIS). Throughout the data collection period PGIS data collection employed a broad definition of terrorism: the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. The data include \"terrorist groups\" identified as specific named groups as well as generic groupings like \"rebels\" or \"student protesters.\" The PGIS database was designed to document every known terrorist event, domestic and international, across countries and time and allows examination of the total number of different types of terrorist events by specific date and geographical region. The data collection and analysis is two-pronged. First, the researchers sought to reliably enter the PGIS data. Second, the researchers continue to assess the validity of the PGIS data and how valid they are as a measure of terrorism by comparing it to other sources, by internally checking records, and by continually examining the database.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"To develop the original Global Terrorism Database (GTD1) [GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE, 1970-1997, (ICPSR 4586)], the researchers arranged with PGIS to move 58 boxes of original hard copies of the PGIS terrorism database to a secure location at the University of Maryland. Once the data were transferred the researchers designed a system for accurately encoding the data. A large computer lab with personal computers for data entry was not a viable option so a Web-based data entry system was developed by computer experts at the University of Maryland to allow a very large number of students to work on the database, using their own equipment, on a flexible schedule. To reduce data entry errors, the data entry interface was designed to match the design of the generic incident card used by PGIS in their coding. This method had the advantage of giving the researchers a good deal of control over the data entry process and a computerized record of the time expended by all of the data coders. Therefore the researchers could easily verify individual coding records for accuracy. Second, once the database codebook and data entry interface was developed, pretesting of both the codebook and the interface was conducted to look for data entry problems. Pretesting identified an array of problems with both the data entry codebook and the Web-based system that was employed to record data. Most of these problems involved clarification of the data entry codebook language, such that data entry rules became increasingly detailed and specific. For example, the researchers created rules for using the value \"unknown.\" In the case of fields indicating the number of persons killed and injured in an event, data entry rules stated that \"unknown\" was to be chosen only if the field stated \"unknown\" on the data card. If the field was blank on the data card, it was assumed that the number killed or injured was zero. In addition, automatic entry fields were created in the Web-based interface to be automatically applied under specific circumstances. For instance, if the event type was entered as a bombing, and the bombing was entered as successful, then the field indicating that damages were incurred was automatically activated by the interface (i.e. the damages checkbox was checked). If an event was entered as a successful kidnapping, then the checkbox indicating that persons were kidnapped in the course of the event was automatically checked. These revisions and additions to the codebook and interface were all made in the interest of increasing data entry reliability while decreasing data entry error. Third, once the researchers were confident in the quality of the data entry procedures, they developed and implemented data entry training procedures. An extensive training manual was added to the data entry codebook for this purpose and a full-day training session for an original group of approximately 70 undergraduate coders was conducted. Over time, training sessions were added as new students joined the project. Finally, once data entry began, the researchers faced the ongoing process of data verification. The original plan was to verify a randomly selected 10 percent of the total cases in the sample. Over the life of the grant until the creation of the database thus far, the project had reached a verification rate of nearly 50 percent. Project members continue to work to consolidate the group list by combining cases where one group uses multiple names or various alternative name spellings. In order to develop the Global Terrorism Database 1.1 (GTD1.1), the research team supplemented the original PGIS data by incorporating incidents found in other data sources that were overlooked by PGIS.

This process is ongoing and is the primary reason that the GTD is an evolving data source. Other data sources include the Conflict Archive on the Internet, the Australian Turkish Media Group, Armenian Terrorism: the past, present, the prospects, by Francis Hyland, the National Abortion Federation, and the \"Further Submissions and Responses by the ANC to Questions Raised by the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation 12 May 1997\".

State and local authorities increasingly need detailed local information about their economies to make informed decisions. The LED Partnership works to fill critical data gaps and provide indicators needed by state and local authorities. \nUnder the LED Partnership, states agree to share unemployment insurance earnings data and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data with the Census Bureau. The LEHD program combines these administrative data, additional administrative data, and data from censuses and surveys. From these data, the program creates statistics on employment, earnings, and job flows at detailed levels of geography and industry and for different demographic groups. In addition, the LEHD program uses these data to create partially synthetic data on workers' residential patterns.\nThe Employer Characteristics File (ECF) consolidates LEHD employer microdata information on size, location, industry, etc., into two easily accessible files. For each firm identified by SEIN, establishment-level data, identified by SEIN-SEINUNIT, is stored in the \"SEINUNIT file.\" Some information is aggregated to the SEIN level, and stored in the \"SEIN file.\" The SEIN file contains no new information, and should be viewed merely as an easier and/or more efficient way of accessing data aggregated to the firm level. Each file contains one record for every YEAR QUARTER a firm and/or establishment is present in either the ES-202 or the UI. All information is subject to extensive data edits and imputation, and the final files contain no missing information. For a more extensive description of data processing in the ECF, we refer the reader to Vilhuber and McKinney (2014). The files can be linked to other Census data through the use of the LEHD SEIN as well as the EIN.\nThis dataset contains firm EIN, firm size, firm age, and firm ID which have been sourced from Federal Tax Information. As a result, they have been removed from the core ECF and stored separately. \nData availability (e.g., years) can vary by state.\nUse of these data requires approval from the Internal Revenue Service and individual state approvals. The Census Bureau will coordinate all reviews.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States. Bureau of the Census.

Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.</p>\n\n<p>Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:<br />\n<ol>\n<li> The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.</li>\n<li>There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors for this period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.</li>\n<li>The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour market trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n<p>The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.</p>\n<p>For current LFS data refer to <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/surveys/3701\" target=\"_blank\">Statistics Canada</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://odesi.scholarsportal.info/documentation/LFHR/2010/data-donnees-eng.html\" target=\"_blank\">Access data here</a></p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nCooper, A. 2014.

The program allows healthcare providers to learn about HBV and diagnose/manage infected persons more effectively. The various forms of hepatitis B can be divided into more aggressive forms (subtypes B2-5) that frequently result in cirrhosis/liver cancer and more \"benign\" forms (subtypes B1 or B6) that rarely do so. Team members analyzed samples from Northern Canadians known to be infected with hepatitis B in the early 1980s. Representative sera from the 1983-85 serum bank were identified and transferred to the investigator's laboratory for testing for occult hepatitis B virus infection. The results revealed that the majority of Northern Canadians are infected with the more \"benign\" B6 subtype. Moreover, the amount of virus present in the circulation was relatively low, another predictor of a good outcome. The study also determined what percent of Northern Canadians are infected despite testing negative by standard diagnostic tests. Finally, the virus itself was analyzed to determine why in some instances it does not cause problems while in others, cirrhosis or liver cancer develop. The latter project was performed in conjunction with researchers from the United States and Denmark. Because HBV-induced rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer are higher in Alaska and Greenland than Northern Canada, collaborations were secured with investigators from these regions who submitted samples from infected individuals. The samples were used for genotyping, sequencing and identifying which HBV mut\nations are associated with adverse versus benign outcomes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Gerald Y.

The moratoria reduced farm foreclosure rates in the short run, but they also appear to have reduced the supply of loans and made credit more expensive for subsequent borrowers.

Those recruited \n for this survey were asked to call back after the president's message \n and give their approval rating of Bush.

Additional questions concerned Bush's understanding of the \n problems of the middle class, Clinton's explanation about his personal \n life, the media's exaggeration of poor economic conditions, where to \n place the blame for the United States' economic problems, paying more \n taxes to improve education, and the future for the next generation of \n Americans.

Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques.

Without disputing the importance of either mechanism, this study tests a third way that law affects behavior, an expressive theory that claims law influences behavior by creating a focal point around which individuals coordinate. The study examined how various forms of third-party \"cheap talk\" influence the behavior of subjects in a Hawk/Dove or Chicken game. Despite the players' conflicting interests, it was found that messages highlighting an equilibrium tend to produce that outcome. Most striking, this result emerged even when the message was selected by an overtly random, mechanical process. A similar result was obtained when the message was delivered by a third-party subject; the latter effect was significantly stronger than the former only when the subject speaker was selected by a merit-based process. These results suggest that, in certain circumstances, law generates compliance not only by sanctions and legitimacy, but also by facilitating coordination around a focal outcome.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"To investigate an alternate way of how law affects behavior.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Nadler, Janice , and Richard McAdams.

The writ of habeas corpus is a remedy regulated by statute and available in federal court to persons \"in custody in violation of the Constitution...\" When a federal court grants a writ of habeas corpus, it orders the state court to release the prisoner, or to repeat the trial, sentencing, or other proceeding that led to the prisoner's custody. Each year, state prisoners file between 16,000 and 18,000 cases seeking habeas corpus relief. The study was the first to collect empirical information about this litigation, a decade after AEDPA was passed. It sought to shed light upon an otherwise unexplored area of habeas corpus law by looking at samples of capital and non-capital cases and describing the court processing and general demographic information of these cases in detail.\nAEDPA changed habeas law by:\n\nEstablishing a 1-year statute of limitation for filing a federal habeas petition, which begins when appeal of the state judgment is complete, and is tolled during \"properly filed\" state post-conviction proceedings;\nAuthorizing federal judges to deny on the merits any claim that a petitioner failed to exhaust in state court;\nProhibiting a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner failed to develop the facts in state court, except in limited circumstances;\nBarring successive petitions, except in limited circumstances; and\nMandating a new standard of review for evaluating state court determinations of fact and applications of constitutional law.\n\nThe information found within this study is for policymakers who design or assess changes in habeas law, for litigants and courts who address the scope and meaning of the habeas statutes, and for researchers who seek information concerning the processing of habeas petitions in federal courts. Descriptive findings are provided detailing petitioner demographics, state proceedings, representation of petitioner in federal court, petitions, type of proceeding challenged, claims raised, intermediate orders, litigation steps, processing time, non-merits dispositions and merits disposition for both capital and non-capital cases which lead into the comparative and explanatory findings that provide information on current and past habeas litigation and how it has been effected by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The study sought to shed light upon an otherwise unexplored area of habeas corpus law and looked at samples of capital and non-capital cases and describes the court processing and general demographic information of these cases in detail. Empirical information about habeas corpus cases filed by state prisoners in United States District Courts under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is provided. This information is intended for policymakers who design or assess changes in habeas law, for litigants and courts who address the scope and meaning of the habeas statutes, and for researchers who seek information concerning the processing of habeas petitions in federal courts.\nSince the enactment of AEDPA, its provisions have been continually litigated. Each year between 16,000 and 18,000 cases, or approximately 1 out of every 14 civil cases filed in federal district courts, are filed by state prisoners seeking habeas corpus relief, and more than 6,000 of these cases reach the courts of appeals. During each term, the Supreme Court devotes a considerable portion of its limited docket to the application or interpretation of AEDPA. Habeas litigation is also a recurring topic of legislative attention.\nThe empirical questions and assumptions about habeas litigation that have been raised in debates about the appropriate scope of habeas review provide the starting point for the research questions in this study. These issues fall into five general categories: (1) time before filing; (2) claims for relief; (3) the operation of defenses with four categories falling underneath: statute of limitations, exhaustion of claims in state court,\nsuccessive petitions, and procedural default; (4) time for processing; (5) merits review and case outcomes.\nThere is very little prior research concerning habeas litigation that contains empirical information. More information is known about the processing of habeas cases prior to AEDPA. Descriptive findings are provided detailing petitioner demographics, state proceedings, representation of petitioner in federal court, petitions, type of proceeding challenged, claims raised, intermediate orders, litigation steps, processing time, non-merits dispositions and merits disposition for both capital and non-capital cases which lead into the comparative and explanatory findings that provide information on current and past habeas litigation and how it has been effected by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Because this was the first empirical examination of the application of AEDPA, the most important contribution of the present study may be to provide a thorough catalogue of descriptive information about habeas litigation. For each of the five general features of habeas review outlined above, the study collected detailed information for both capital and non-capital cases. Additionally, the study built on research prior to AEDPA to examine the differences between pre-AEDPA and post-AEDPA processing of habeas cases in order to identify the possible effects of the 1996 amendments. The study also examined the differences between the processing of capital and non-capital habeas cases.\nThe final capital case sample was 368 capital cases, representing filings by 348 death row inmates drawn from districts with the highest volume of capital habeas filings and the final non-capital case sample was 2,378, approximately 6.5 percent of all 36,745 non-capital habeas filings by state prisoners during the sample period.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"Data collected for each case included: demographic information about the prisoner; the nature of the state decision challenged; information about the petitioner's state offense and sentence; proceedings in state courts; petitions; amendments to petitions; in forma pauperis and representation status; post-petition pleadings (answers, motions, and replies); magistrate judge involvement; discovery; evidentiary hearings; stays; rulings on certificates of appealability; number of claims raised; and number of docket entries. The timing of various procedural events was tracked with over a dozen separate date variables.

Despite extensive research in the field and a significant progress made, especially in understanding the range of possible malformations and neurobehavioral abnormalities, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol responses in development are still not well understood. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies looking at the changes in gene expression after PAE in animal models, however there is a limited apparent consensus among the reported findings. In an effort to address this issue, we performed a comprehensive re-analysis and meta-analysis of all suitable, publically available expression data sets.\n\nMethods:\nWe assembled ten microarray data sets of gene expression after PAE in mouse and rat models consisting of samples from a total of 63 ethanol-exposed and 80 control animals. We re-analyzed each data set for differential expression and then used the results to perform meta-analyses considering all data sets together or grouping them by time or duration of exposure (pre- and post-natal, acute and chronic, respectively). We performed network and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to further characterize the identified signatures.\n\nResults:\nFor each sub-analysis we identified signatures of differential expressed genes that show support from multiple studies. Overall, the changes in gene expression were more extensive after acute ethanol treatment during prenatal development than in other models. Considering the analysis of all the data together, we identified a robust core signature of 104 genes down-regulated after PAE, with no up-regulated genes. Functional analysis reveals over-representation of genes involved in protein synthesis, mRNA splicing and chromatin organization.\n\nConclusions:\nOur meta-analysis shows that existing studies, despite superficial dissimilarity in findings, share features that allow us to identify a common core signature set of transcriptome changes in PAE. This is an important step to identifying the biological processes that underlie the etiology of FASD.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Rogic, Sanja; Wong, Albertina ; Pavlidis, Paul, 2016, \"Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling\", http://hdl.handle.net/11272/10543 University of British Columbia [Distributor] V3 [Version]","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Rogic S, Wong A, Pavlidis P. \"Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling.\" Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research. 2016;40(4):717-727. doi:10.1111/acer.13007.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Rogic, Sanja","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Wong, Albertina ","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Pavlidis, Paul","metadata-type":"element"},{"prodPlac":"Vancouver, BC","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"metaanalysis","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"gene expression","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"fetal alcohol spectrum disorder","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"prenatal alcohol exposure","metadata-type":"element"},{"producer":"Department of Psychiatry\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"producer":"Michael Smith Laboratories\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"producer":"University of British Columbia\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"prodDate":"2016","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2018","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Meta-analysis of gene expression patterns in animal models of prenatal alcohol exposure suggests role for protein synthesis inhibition and chromatin remodeling","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":419,"uri":"/icpsr/13375.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/13375.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F13375.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/13375.xml\")/codeBook/stdyDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Census"}," ",{"highlight":"of"}," Population and Housing, 2000 [United States]: Summary File 3, North Carolina  "]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"Summary File 3 contains sample data, which is the information\n compiled from the questions asked of a sample of all people and housing\n units in the United States.

The researchers utilized the FJSRC database to examine the prevalence and characteristics of CSEC offenses and offenders across all stages of the federal criminal justice system, including: criminal suspects investigated by U.S. attorneys, persons arrested by federal law enforcement, defendants prosecuted and adjudicated in U.S. district court, and offenders sentenced and imprisoned. To measure and assess trends in the federal prosecution of CSEC offenders, the research approach defined a key analytic cohort, defendants in cases filed in U.S. district court each fiscal year, from 1998 to 2005-and used the FJSRC data linking system and its special \"link index file\" to link the cohort to data from both prior and subsequent stages of case processing.\nTo identify CSEC defendants in the FJSRC database that comprised the cohort, the researchers relied on the criminal statutes of the U.S. Criminal Code (mainly those from Chapter 110 of Title 18) that pertains to CSEC crimes. The list of the specific statutes included were informed by several interviews that were conducted with federal prosecutors who routinely worked on and prosecuted CSEC cases for the U.S. Department of Justice. The statutes were also informed by feedback obtained from Polaris Project, whose staff were in the field working together with victims and prosecutors of CSEC cases on a daily basis. The researchers organized descriptive statistics in a set of detailed tables that covered all stages of case processing (including arrest, investigation, prosecution, adjudication, and sentencing), as well as defendant demographics such as race, gender, age, citizenship, and marital status.\nSince CSEC covers several different types or \"groupings\" of offenses that vary considerably on many aspects, including offense seriousness, associated penalties, and offender characteristics, the researchers developed a typology of CSEC offenses that were used to organize and display information in the descriptive tables. This typology, with groupings of federal statutes associated with each type, consists of the following three CSEC offenses:\n\nSexual exploitation of children\nChild pornography\nChild prostitution/sex trafficking\nIn addition to the descriptive analyses described below, the researchers also conducted a variety of multivariate predictive analyses. First, the researchers conducted a time series analysis to assess the impact of federal initiatives (e.g., passage of the TVPA) on CSEC prosecutions. Then the researchers constructed multivariate predictive models to analyze the key case outcomes of case disposition (conviction or not) and sentence length imposed, for those who were convicted. The researchers used logistic regression modeling, with case disposition as the dependent variable, to examine the characteristics related to conviction (guilty pleas, as well as trial outcomes), and also used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to build multivariate models predicting sentence length.\nInterviews were conducted with an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the District of Columbia, two prosecutors from the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) within the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a prosecutor from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division - all of whom had experience prosecuting CSEC offenders at the Federal level. The FJSRC link index file is a publicly available file of unique sequential number identifiers that permits the linking of records from different agency data files across various stages of processing. For example, users can link arrest data with case disposition and sentencing data. This feature allows for the tracking of an analytic cohort of offenders to prior and/or subsequent stages, thus permitting the ability to build a more comprehensive dossier of case history and characteristics for each defendant-case in the cohort.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The variables included in the data collection include information from the Federal Justice Statistics Resource Center (FJSRC), such as: unique sequential number identifiers (for files, cases, etc.), arresting agency, offense at arrest, month and year of arrest, as well as the arrestee's county of birth, age, gender, race, citizenship status, marital status, and other demographics.

The water level in the pipe or riser casing reaches, after some rest time, a static position or elevation, z2.  Then, the water level position is changed rapidly, by adding or removing some water volume, or by inserting or removing a solid slug.  Afterward, the water level position or elevation z1(t) is recorded vs. time t, yielding a difference in hydraulic head or water column defined as Z(t) = z1(t) - z2.  The water level at rest is assumed to be the piezometric level or PL for the tested zone, before drilling a hole and installing test equipment.  All equations use Z(t) or Z*(t) = Z(t) / Z(t=0).  The water-level response vs. time may be a slow return to equilibrium (overdamped test), or an oscillation back to equilibrium (underdamped test).  This document deals exclusively with overdamped tests.  Their data may be analyzed using several methods, known to yield different results for the hydraulic conductivity.  The methods fit in three groups: group 1 neglects the influence of the solid matrix strain, group 2 is for tests in aquitards with delayed strain caused by consolidation, and group 3 takes into account some elastic and instant solid matrix strain.  This document briefly explains what is wrong with certain theories and why.  It shows three ways to plot the data, which are the three diagnostic graphs.  According to experience with thousands of tests, most test data are biased by an incorrect estimate z2 of the piezometric level at rest.  The derivative or velocity plot does not depend upon this assumed piezometric level, but can verify its correctness.  The document presents experimental results and explains the three-diagnostic graphs approach, which unifies the theories and, most important, yields a user-independent result.  Two free spreadsheet files are provided. The spreadsheet \"Lefranc-Test-English-Model\" follows the Canadian standards and is used to explain how to treat correctly the test data to reach a user-independent result.  The user does not modify this model spreadsheet but can make as many copies as needed, with different names.  The user can treat any other data set in a copy, and can also modify any copy if needed.  The second Excel spreadsheet contains several sets of data that can be used to practice with the copies of the model spreadsheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>En génie civil et géologique, on a utilisé depuis plus d'un siècle les essais in situ de perméabilité à niveau variable (essais VH ou slug tests), afin d'évaluer la conductivité hydraulique locale des sols et rocs testés. Le niveau d'eau dans le tuyau ou le tubage prend, après une période de repos, une position ou élévation statique, z2. Ensuite, on modifie rapidement la position du niveau d'eau, en ajoutant ou en enlevant rapi-dement un volume d'eau, ou en insérant ou retirant un objet solide.  La position ou l'élévation du niveau d'eau, z1(t), est alors notée en fonction du temps, t, ce qui donne une différence de charge hydraulique définie par Z(t) = z1(t) - z2. Le niveau d'eau au repos est supposé être le niveau piézométrique pour la zone testée, avant de forer un trou et d'installer l'équipement pour un essai. Toutes les équations utilisent Z(t) ou Z*(t) = Z(t) / Z(t=0). La réponse du niveau d'eau avec le temps peut être soit un lent retour à l'équilibre (cas suramorti) soit une oscillation amortie retournant à l'équilibre (cas sous-amorti). Ce document ne traite que des cas suramortis. Leurs données peuvent être analysées à l'aide de plusieurs méthodes, connues pour donner des résultats différents pour la conductivité hydraulique. Les méthodes appartiennent à trois groupes : le groupe 1 néglige l'influence de la déformation de la matrice solide, le groupe 2 est pour les essais dans des aquitards avec une déformation différée causée par la consolidation, et le groupe 3 prend en compte une certaine déformation élastique et instantanée de la matrice solide. Ce document explique brièvement ce qui est incorrect dans les théories et pourquoi.  Il montre trois façons de tracer les données, qui sont les trois graphiques de diagnostic.  Selon l'expérience de milliers d'essais, la plupart des données sont biaisées par un estimé incorrect de z2, le niveau piézométrique supposé.  Le graphe de la dérivée ou graphe des vitesses ne dépend pas de la valeur supposée pour le niveau piézomé-trique, mais peut vérifier son exactitude.  Le document présente des résultats expérimentaux et explique le diagnostic à trois graphiques, qui unifie les théories et donne un résultat indépendant de l'utilisateur, ce qui est important.  Deux fichiers Excel gratuits sont fournis.  Le fichier\"Lefranc-Test-English-Model\" suit les normes canadiennes : il sert à expliquer comment traiter correctement les données d'essai pour avoir un résultat indépendant de l'utilisateur.  Celui-ci ne modifie pas ce fichier modèle mais peut en faire autant de copies que nécessaire, avec des noms différents.  L'utilisateur peut traiter un autre jeu de données dans une copie, et il peut modifier une copie si c'est nécessaire.  Le second fichier Excel contient plusieurs jeux de données, qui peuvent être utilisés pour s'exercer avec les copies du fichier modèle.</p>","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Chapuis, Robert P., 2020, \"Field Variable Permeability Tests (Slug Tests) in Boreholes Made by Driven Flush-Joint Casings, or Driven Flush-Joint Casing Permeameters, or Between Packers in Cored Rock Boreholes, or in Monitoring Wells ― Overdamped Response / Essais de perméabilité à niveau variable (Slug Tests) dans des forages faits avec un tubage battu à joints lisses, ou un perméamètre battu à joints lisses, ou entre des obturateurs dans un trou foré dans le roc, ou dans un puits de surveillance ― Cas de la réponse suramortie\", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/YUAUGX, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Polytechnique Montréal","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Chapuis, Robert P.","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"engineering","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"permeability tests field variable head hydraulic conductivity explanations free files essais de perméabilité terrain niveau variable conductivité hydraulique explications fichiers gratuits","metadata-type":"element"},{"date":"9999","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Field Variable Permeability Tests (Slug Tests) in Boreholes Made by Driven Flush-Joint Casings, or Driven Flush-Joint Casing Permeameters, or Between Packers in Cored Rock Boreholes, or in Monitoring Wells ― Overdamped Response / Essais de perméabilité à niveau variable (Slug Tests) dans des forages faits avec un tubage battu à joints lisses, ou un perméamètre battu à joints lisses, ou entre des obturateurs dans un trou foré dans le roc, ou dans un puits de surveillance ― Cas de la réponse suramortie","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":436,"uri":"/icpsr/01297.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/01297.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F01297.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/01297.xml\")/codeBook/stdyDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Casino"}," ",{"highlight":"Gaming"}," ",{"highlight":"and"}," ",{"highlight":"Local"}," ",{"highlight":"Employment"}," ",{"highlight":"Trends"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/01297.xml\")/codeBook/stdyDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":[{"highlight":"1297"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/01297.xml\")/codeBook/stdyDscr/citation/rspStmt/AuthEnty","match-text":[{"highlight":"Garrett"},", ",{"highlight":"Thomas"}," A."]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"Casino gambling has become a major industry in the United\n States.

Despite extensive research in the field and a significant progress made, especially in understanding the range of possible malformations and neurobehavioral abnormalities, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol responses in development are still not well understood. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies looking at the changes in gene expression after PAE in animal models, however there is a limited apparent consensus among the reported findings. In an effort to address this issue, we performed a comprehensive re-analysis and meta-analysis of all suitable, publically available expression data sets.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methods:<br>\r\nWe assembled ten microarray data sets of gene expression after PAE in mouse and rat models consisting of samples from a total of 63 ethanol-exposed and 80 control animals. We re-analyzed each data set for differential expression and then used the results to perform meta-analyses considering all data sets together or grouping them by time or duration of exposure (pre- and post-natal, acute and chronic, respectively). We performed network and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to further characterize the identified signatures.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results:<br>\r\nFor each sub-analysis we identified signatures of differential expressed genes that show support from multiple studies. Overall, the changes in gene expression were more extensive after acute ethanol treatment during prenatal development than in other models. Considering the analysis of all the data together, we identified a robust core signature of 104 genes down-regulated after PAE, with no up-regulated genes. Functional analysis reveals over-representation of genes involved in protein synthesis, mRNA splicing and chromatin organization.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusions:<br>\r\nOur meta-analysis shows that existing studies, despite superficial dissimilarity in findings, share features that allow us to identify a common core signature set of transcriptome changes in PAE.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data\n collection, 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection, and\n 4,850 were interviewed in the Wave 3 data collection.\n Data collection for Wave 3 began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It included a \n letter sent to study participants notifying them that they would be \n contacted to schedule an interview. Additional information on the contact log \n included the dates and research assistant ID of the Wave 2 interview (or the \n status of the case if incomplete in Wave 2), a list of household composition \n and ID numbers of other household members in the study, the name the telephone \n was listed under, the recontact information from Waves 1 and 2, and an \n updated history of addresses.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated\n telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in\n Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 3 who lived\n outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants\n were able to travel for interviews. In Wave 3, phone interviews were\n also conducted with the study participants in Cohort 15. People who\n refused to complete the two-hour in-person interview were administered\n the phone interview. A total of 391 telephone interviews were\n conducted during Wave 3, representing 6.3 percent of the sample.\n Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were\n emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The\n study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's\n interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 3, one primary\n caregiver and eleven study participants (young adults) were\n interviewed in jail. They were located in either the Cook County Jail\n or in one of the state prisons. Those study participants in a state\n system outside the nine-county area were also interviewed by phone.\n Study participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The\n Department of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of\n the foster parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief\n period in Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who\n could not be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in\n foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or\n 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were\n interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care\n during Wave 2.\n Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 3, an abbreviated version of the primary\n caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant\n arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In\n Wave 3, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish.\n Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were\n paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free\n passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also\n included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n For primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an\n addendum interview was administered consisting of measures or portions\n of measures from the Wave 2 interview. An addendum was also given to\n the Cohort 15 and 18 study participants who were not included in Wave\n 2. A total of 164 primary caregivers and 62 young adult (Cohorts 15\n and 18) addendums were completed in Wave 3.\n Provision of Social Relations (Primary Caregiver)\n The Provision of Social Relations (Primary Caregiver) instrument\n was administered to the primary caregivers of the subjects belonging\n to Cohorts 0 to 15 to evaluate the social support received by the\n primary caregiver from family and friends.

Respondents were asked to rate how true a\n series of statements were for them. The series included such\n statements as \"I share the same approach to life that many of my\n friends do\", \"No matter what happens, I know that my family will\n always be there for me should I need them\", and \"My friends would take\n the time to talk about my problems, should I ever want to\".\n Respondents were also asked if there was anyone in particular they\n thought helped them when they needed it and, if so, to give this\nperson's relationship to themselves.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

We find that partisan elites, the media, and citizens each played critical and interdependent roles in creating the dynamics of the campaign and producing the closest election\nin decades.

Due to the sensitive nature of the survey, female\n respondents were interviewed by female interviewers. In order to test\n for possible bias caused by the gender of the interviewers when\n speaking to men, a split sample was used so that half of the male\n respondents had female interviewers and the other half had male\n interviewers. The questionnaires contained 14 sections, each covering\n a different topic, as follows. Section A: Respondents' fears of\n different types of violence, and behaviors they had adopted to\n accommodate those fears. Section B: Respondent demographics and\n household characteristics. Section C: The number of current and past\n marital and opposite-sex and same-sex cohabitating relationships of the\n respondent. Section D: Characteristics of the respondent's current\n relationship and the demographics and other characteristics of their\n spouse and/or partner. Section E: Power, control, and emotional abuse\n by each spouse or partner. Sections F through I: Screening for\n incidents of rape, physical assault, stalking, and threat\n victimization, respectively. Sections J through M: Detailed\n information on each incident of rape, physical assault, stalking, and\n threat victimization, respectively, reported by the respondent for\n each type of perpetrator identified in the victimization screening\n section. Section N: Violence in the respondent's current\n relationship, including steps taken because of violence in the\n relationship and whether the violent behavior had stopped. The section\n concluded with items to assess if the respondent had symptoms\n associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Other variables in the\n data include interviewer gender, respondent gender, number of adult\n women and adult men in the household, number of different telephones\nin the household, and region code.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"To further the understanding of violence against\n women, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the National Center\n for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control\n and Prevention (CDC), jointly sponsored the National Violence Against\n Women (NVAW) Survey. When this survey was conceived, many gaps\n remained in the understanding of violence against women, despite the\n large amount of research on violence against women, particularly in\n the areas of rape and intimate partner violence. Empirical data on the\n relationship between certain types of violence against women, such as\n childhood victimization and subsequent adult victimization, were\n limited. Reliable information on minority women's experiences with\n violence and on the consequences of violence against women, including\n rates of injury and use of medical services, was also limited. To\n provide a context in which to place women's experiences, the NVAW\n Survey sampled both women and men. The survey was designed to\n accomplish the following goals: (1) to provide reliable estimates of\n the prevalence and incidence of various forms of violence against\n women, including rape, physical assault, and stalking, (2) to provide\n descriptive data on victims and perpetrators, including male-to-female\n and female-to-male intimate partners and victims of different racial\n and ethnic backgrounds, (3) to provide descriptive data on the\n physical, psychological, and social consequences of violent\n victimization, including injured victims' use of medical services, (4)\n to examine the links between threats of violence and actual\n occurrences of violence, (5) to examine the links between\n victimization, fear of violence, and coping strategies, (6) to examine\n how women respond to specific victimization, including their\n involvement in the criminal justice system, (7) to provide information\n on violence perpetrated on men and women by same-sex intimate\n partners, and (8) to provide comparable information on the experiences\n of men that would permit comparisons of the prevalence of violence and\n severity of injury suffered by women as opposed to men abused by\nintimates.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The National Violence Against Women Survey was\n conducted by interviewers at Schulman, Ronca, Bucuvalas, Inc. (SRBI),\n a national survey research organization in New York City, under the\n direction of Dr. John Boyle. Survey design and data analysis were\n conducted by the principal investigators of this study. Following an\n extensive pre-test, completed interviews were obtained using a\n computer-assisted interviewing system from 8,000 women and 8,005 men\n who were 18 years of age or older residing in households throughout\n the United States. The female version of the survey was fielded during\n November 1995 to May 1996. The male version of the survey was fielded\n during February to May 1996. Spanish versions of both the male and\n female surveys were fielded during April to May 1996. Respondents to\n the NVAW Survey were queried about (1) their general fear of violence\n and the ways in which they managed their fears, (2) emotional abuse\n they had experienced by marital and cohabitating partners, (3)\n physical assault they had experienced as children by adult caretakers,\n (4) physical assault they had experienced as adults by any type of\n perpetrator, (5) forcible rape or stalking they had experienced by any\n type of perpetrator, and (6) incidents of threatened violence they had\n experienced by any type of perpetrator. Respondents disclosing\n victimization were asked detailed questions about the characteristics\n and consequences of their victimization, including injuries sustained\n and use of medical services. Incidents were recorded that had\n occurred at any time during the respondent's lifetime and also those\n that occurred within the 12 months prior to the interview. Both male\n and female respondents were queried about their experiences with\n emotional abuse, threats, and violence by same-sex intimate partners.\n Interviewers were trained to recognize and respond appropriately to\n cues indicating that the respondent may have been concerned about\n being overheard. Telephone numbers of local support services (e.g.,\n domestic violence shelters, rape crisis hotlines, child protective\n services) were offered to respondents who disclosed current abuse or\n who appeared in distress. Initial telephone contact with households\n was attempted during hours of the day and days of the week that had\n the greatest probability of respondent contact. Due to the sensitive\n nature of the survey, female respondents were interviewed by female\n interviewers. In order to test for possible bias caused by the gender\n of the interviewers when speaking to men, a split sample was used so\n that half of the male respondents had female interviewers and the\n other half had male interviewers. A Spanish-language translation was\n administered by bilingual interviewers for Spanish-speaking\nrespondents.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The questionnaires contained 14 sections, each\n covering a different topic. Section A of the survey asked respondents\n about their fear of violence and accommodation behavior. Variables\n from Section A include the respondent's overall assessment of whether\n personal safety for women had improved since the respondent was a\n child, or whether violent crime, domestic violence, sexual harassment,\n and sexual assault were more of a problem today. Respondents also\n indicated how concerned they were about their personal safety and\n about being stalked, whether they had ever been stalked and by whom,\n whether they carried something to defend themselves or to alert others\n and, if so, how often, and what they carried. Section B recorded\n respondent characteristics, including information on age, employment,\n medical coverage, education, race, number of adults and number of\n children living with the respondent, personal income, household\n income, and telephone service. Health-related variables include\n general assessment of health, whether the respondent had ever\n sustained a serious injury, had a chronic health condition, or had a\n chronic mental health condition and, if so, the ages at onset, and\n information on pregnancies, depression, alcohol use, and drug use.\n Section C recorded information on the number of the respondent's\n current and past marital and opposite-sex and same-sex cohabitating\n relationships. Section D recorded characteristics of the respondent's\n current relationship and current spouse/partner, including how long they had\n known each other, how long they lived together, and how long they were\n married, as well as the spouse/partner's age, employment, education,\n race, income, general health, and alcohol use. Section E obtained\n information on power, control, and emotional abuse by each spouse or\n partner. Specific variables include whether the spouse/partner had a\n hard time seeing things from the respondent's point of view, was\n jealous or possessive, provoked arguments, limited the respondent's\n contact with family or friends, insisted on knowing who the respondent\n was with at all times, called the respondent names, made the\n respondent feel inadequate, was frightened of the respondent, shouted\n or swore at the respondent, frightened the respondent, prevented the\n respondent from access to family income, prevented the respondent from\n working outside the home, or insisted on changing residences even when\n the respondent did not need or want to. Sections F through I screened\n for incidents of rape, physical assault, stalking, and threat\n victimization, respectively. Variables include screening questions\n specific to each type of victimization followed by variables\n identifying the relationship of each type of perpetrator to the\n respondent (current spouse, ex-spouse, male live-in partner, female\n live-in partner, other relative, acquaintance, or stranger), and then\n repeated to identify which spouse or partner (from current up to eight\n previous), specific relative, specific acquaintance\n (boyfriend/girlfriend/date, other men/boys, other women/girls, various\n other acquaintance categories), or male or female stranger. Sections J\n through M provide detailed information on each incident of rape,\n physical assault, stalking, and threat victimization, respectively,\n reported by the respondent. For each type of perpetrator identified in\n the victimization section, information is provided on the\n victimization, including number of times the victimization happened,\n if the incident occurred while the respondent was still in a\n relationship with the perpetrator, first and last time the incident\n happened, if the incident happened in the last 12 months, who was\n first to use force, drug or alcohol use at the time of the incident,\n resulting pregnancies, weapon use, injuries, medical, dental, and\n mental health care, how care was covered, days the respondent took off\n from various activities, reporting of the incident to the police or to\n others, if the respondent obtained a restraining order, if the\n offender violated the restraining order, if criminal charges were\n filed, if the offender was convicted, if the offender was sentenced to\n jail or prison, and if the respondent was satisfied with how he/she\n was treated during the court process. Section N recorded information\n about violence in the respondent's current relationship, including\n whether the respondent ever left the relationship, and if so, how many\n days he/she stayed away and where he/she stayed, the reason he/she\n returned home, if violence increased or decreased after returning\n home, if the spouse/partner ever left the relationship because of\n their violence toward the respondent, and how many different times\n they left. Variables also include information on children living with\n the respondent at the time of the incident, if the spouse/partner\n received counseling for their violent behavior, and if the respondent\n thought the violent behavior had stopped. The section concludes with\n variables to assess if the respondent had symptoms associated with\n post-traumatic stress disorder. Other variables in the data include\n interviewer gender, respondent gender, number of adult women and adult\n men in the household, number of different telephones in the household,\nand region code.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Tjaden, Patricia, and Nancy Thoennes.

The\nAdd Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents' social, economic, psychological, and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood. The files contained in this component of the Add Health restricted data are Waves I-III Contextual Files Data, Waves I-II Neighborhood Data, Wave I Spatial Analysis Data, Waves III-IV Grouping File Data, and Waves III-IV Census Region data. The contextual files data contain community contextual variables based on state, county, tract, and block group levels derived from Waves I, II, and III addresses. The neighborhood data and grouping file data contain pseudo state, county, tract, and block group variables that allow grouping Add Health respondents geographically. Wave I Spatial Analysis Data include X, Y coordinates that can be used to calculate distances between friends in a school community.

Le principal sujet de cette septième initiative d'approche participative était de savoir de quelle manière la pandémie de la COVID-19 a eu un effet sur la confiance dans les différentes institutions, le grand public et les voisins, en plus de déterminer si l'expérience de la discrimination avant et durant la pandémie a eu un effet disproportionné sur certains groupes plus que sur d'autres. </p>\n\n<p>Dans le contexte de ce produit, le terme approche participative se réfère au processus de recueillir de l'information par le biais d'un questionnaire en ligne.

Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). Other topics include attitudes toward religion, changing roles for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to drug education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Miech, Richard A., Lloyd D.

Respondents were asked if they had favorable or unfavorable\nopinions of Texas governor George Bush, former New Jersey senator\nBill Bradley, Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes,\nconservative commentator Pat Buchanan, and talk show host Alan Keyes.\nOther questions asked if respondents were following the presidential\ncampaign, if they would vote Democratic or Republican if they were\nvoting today, if they would be voting in a caucus, whom they would\nvote for and if that was their final decision, and out of various\npossible Democrat/Republican pairings, which of the two they would\nvote for in a presidential election (e.g., McCain vs. Gore, Bush vs.\nBradley, etc.). Another focus of this poll was race relations and the\nrole of national and local government in addressing this issue.\nQuestions probed respondents' knowledge of American Black history and\nto what degree public schools teach Black history, who the most\nimportant Black role model was, whether computers and the Internet\nwould improve opportunities for Blacks, and whether respondents\nviewed the following organizations and persons favorably: the\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),\nthe Nation of Islam, General Colin Powell, Jesse Jackson, and Nation\nof Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Respondents were asked whether\nAmerica was ready for a Black president, whether they would vote for\na party-nominated Black presidential candidate, which political party\nwas more likely to try to fix race relations, what they thought about\nSouth Carolina's flying the Confederate flag, and whether the\npresidential candidates should express their opinions on this issue.\nQuestions were asked regarding race equality, race relations in the\nrespondent's community, how respondents viewed the existence and\npersistence of racial discrimination, whether it could be cured, and\nhow important this issue was to the future of the United States.\nRespondents were asked additional questions concerning race\nrelations, including whether the government should try to improve\nrace relations, whether it was paying the appropriate amount of\nattention to the needs of minorities, and if the criminal justice\nsystem was racially biased. Further questions addressed attitudes and\nbehaviors of the police toward individuals and minorities, including\nthe use of inappropriate language, respectful behavior, and \"racial\nprofiling,\" and if police were considered friends or enemies.\nRegarding personal experiences with racism and perceptions of its\nrelevance in society, respondents were asked how many Black people\nthey worked with, how many lived in their neighborhoods, attended\nlocal public schools, and shopped at their stores, whether\nrespondents made a point to patronize minority-owned businesses, how\nrespondents perceived the number of white people who disliked Blacks\nand vice versa, and if the respondent had ever felt discriminated\nagainst and why. In regard to racism in the workplace, questions were\nasked to gauge respondents' opinions of affirmative action, personal\nexperience with discrimination on the job or in trying to obtain a\njob, and whether successful Blacks had a duty to help other Blacks.\nRespondents were also asked if there were adequate numbers of Blacks\nemployed as teachers, professional sports players, businesspersons\nwho owned large companies, medical doctors, and coaches and team\nexecutives. Also asked were questions about opportunities to succeed\nin today's world as compared to the respondents' parents' generation\nand future generations. A set of questions was asked to assess\nperceptions of the poor in America, including whether respondents\nbelieved being poor was the result of a lack of effort or\ncircumstances, if it was still possible in America to start from\nhumble beginnings and become wealthy, and if Blacks or whites were\nmore likely to be poor. General questions focused on whether\nrespondents had access to a computer, the Internet, or email, if they\nvoted in the 1996 presidential election and, if so, for whom they\nvoted, whether the respondent did volunteer work in the last year,\nwhether there were children in the respondent's household under the\nage of 18 or between the ages of 12 and 18, and if any of the\nchildren were a part of the class of 2000. Background information on\nrespondents includes voter registration status, employment status,\nmarital status, party affiliation, self-placement on the\nliberal-conservative continuum, religious preference and frequency of\nattendance, military service, education, age, Hispanic descent,\nincome, and whether there was another phone line in their house.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News.

Respondents were queried on how closely they had been following the World Cup soccer competition, whether the World Cup competition had made them more or less interested in soccer, whether they would rather live through a really hot summer or a really cold winter, whether they feel more or less relaxed over the summer than they do during other times of the year, whether they try to get a suntan in the summer, and whether they read more books during the summer. Respondents were also asked whether they thought BP's relief wells would stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico by August of 2010, whether they favored or opposed a policy passed in a Nebraska town which required businesses and landlords to verify that their employees and renters were in the United States legally, whether they would prefer to travel to the past or to the future if time travel existed, and whether they thought that Americans of \"Generation Y\", or people born after 1980 would have a better or worse quality of life than that of the baby boomers. Finally respondents were asked whether they voted in the 2008 presidential election and who they voted for, whether they voted for a United States House of Representative in the 2006 election and which candidate they voted for, what year was the most recent election of any kind that they had voted in, and how long they have been living at their address.

Fifty tables are presented at the block level and higher, 255 at the block group level and higher and 106 at the census tract level and higher. Additionally, the tables are iterated for the urban and rural geographic components of municipalities and 21 geographic components of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as a whole: 15 urban components (total urban, urbanized areas, urban clusters, and urbanized areas and urban clusters of various population sizes) and 6 rural components (total rural, rural areas outside places, rural areas inside places and inside places of various population sizes).\n\nDue to problems in the initial version, the Census Bureau ultimately issued the tables as three data products. The first or main release comprises 34 data files with all the tables except PBG7 (Nativity by Citizen Status by Year of Entry), PBG9 (Year of Entry for the Foreign-born Population) and ten tables on selected monthly owner costs, the tables HBG75, HBG76, HBG77, HBG78, HBG79, HBG80, HBG81, HCT18, HCT19 and HCT20. The second, called the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Year of Entry Summary File, consists of two data files with the tables PBG7 and PBG9. The third is a document file with the ten tables on selected monthly owner costs. ICPSR provides each product as a separate ZIP archive.

Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the timeliest and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 10 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.</p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.</p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced.</p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Employment and Social Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.</p>\n\n<p> Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values.</p>\n\n<p> LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996.</p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2016.

The survey provides a detailed description of the characteristics of the last job held as well as reasons for not receiving benefits or for not claiming.\n\nThrough the survey data, analysts will also be able to observe the characteristics and situation of people not covered by EI and of those who exhausted EI benefits, the job search intensity of the unemployed, expectation of recall to a job, and alternate sources of income and funds.\n\nSurvey data pertaining to maternity and parental benefits answer questions on the proportion of mothers of an infant who received maternity and parental benefits, the reason why some mothers do not receive benefits and about sharing parental benefits with their spouse. The survey also allows looking at the timing and circumstances related to the return to work, the income adequacy of households with young children and more.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Statistics Canada.

Same-sex couples came to Vermont from all over the country to legalize their relationships. During the first year that this legislation was enacted, 80 percent of civil unions were acquired by out-of-state residents. In 2002, a project was conducted that compared couples who had civil unions in Vermont during the first year of that new legislation (July 2000-June 2001) with same-sex couples in their friendship circles who had not had civil unions, and with heterosexual married siblings (Solomon, Rothblum, and Balsam, 2004; 2005). The focus was on demographic factors, length of relationship, social support from family and friends, contact with families of origin, social and political activities, degree of \"outness,\" and division of housework, child care, and finances. This was the first study to focus on same-sex couples in legalized relationships in the United States. It was also the first study to examine same-sex couples recruited from a population instead of a convenience sample, because civil unions are a matter of public record. Results indicated very few differences between same-sex couples in civil unions and those not in civil unions, particularly for women. Women in civil unions were more \"out\" about their sexual orientation, and more likely to consider themselves married than were women not in civil unions. Men in civil unions were more likely to have children, joint bank accounts with their partner, mutual friends with their partner, more connection with their family of origin, and to consider themselves married. They were less likely to have seriously discussed ending their relationship than men not in civil unions (Solomon et al., 2004). In contrast, both types of same-sex couples differed from heterosexual married couples in numerous ways. Same-sex couples were in their current relationship for a shorter duration, less religious, less likely to have children, more likely to share housework and finances, and less close to their family of origin than heterosexual couples. Women in same-sex relationships were more highly educated and perceived less social support from their family of origin than heterosexual married women. Men in same-sex relationships lived in larger cities, were less monogamous and more likely to agree that non-monogamy was acceptable, and perceived more social support from their friends than heterosexual married men. It is not surprising that same-sex couples differed from heterosexual couples. Prior research on lesbians and gay men from convenience samples that compared them to (a) United States census data (e.g., Bradford and Ryan, 1988), (b) their heterosexual siblings (e.g., Rothblum, et al., 2004; Rothblum and Factor, 2001), and (c) representative national samples (e.g., Laumann, Gagnon, Michael and Michaels, 1994) have consistently indicated demographic differences. It was also not surprising that same-sex couples in civil unions were quite similar to same-sex couples not in civil unions given that the first study was conducted after the first year of the new legislation. Consequently, that study was more about who chooses to have a civil union versus those who do not. It was less about how being in a civil union changes a relationship -- for that, follow-up research is needed. Demographic variables include age, race, education, religion, sexual orientation, income, and occupation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"When Vermont became the first state in the United States to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples, it marked an important milestone in lesbian and gay Americans' struggle for equal rights.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.</p>\n\n<p>L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories.</p>\n\n<p>Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note importante</strong> : Étant donné que les valeurs manquantes n'apparaissent pas dans ces ensembles de données, toute forme de non-réponse (e.g. saut valide, indéterminé) ou ne sais pas/refus ne peuvent pas être codées comme manquantes.

Each research team was responsible for identifying the 15 organizations in their city that fit the criteria of largest 501(c)(3): secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, institution of higher education, Junior League, community foundation, YMCA, YWCA, secular family services, Catholic family services, and Jewish family services. The process resulted in a board-level data set of about ninety organizations that would be directly comparable across cities; researchers then collected demographic information on the trustees of each organization during the years 1931, 1961, and 1991. Researchers collected data on 8,926 individual trustees from 289 separate boards (approximately 15 organizations' boards for each of six cities over three different time periods).

Trustee lists were either obtained from the organization itself, annual reports, or the IRS 990 forms. Once the trustee lists were acquired, the study team in each city began background research on the trustees in order to provide answers on the trustee code sheets. The project coordinator provided research teams in each city with codesheets indicating the information to be collected. Memoranda were sent to researchers with instructions as questions arose or coding procedures changed. The research teams collected biographical information on trustees through print sources, Nexis searches, and interviews. They completed the codesheets as thoroughly as possible given the information available. There is extensive missing data in this study due to factors such as a lack of adequate records from 1931 and uncooperative organizations.

The survey was designed and implemented in partnership with national Aboriginal organizations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the second time the Aboriginal Peoples Survey has been carried out by Statistics Canada; the first time was in the fall of 1991. The data from the 1991 APS were widely used. An extremely important user of the 1991 data was the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). They used the data as a primary source of demographic, social and economic data for their final report and related research studies. The Commission's final report recommended that APS be conducted regularly to monitor the demographic and social conditions of Aboriginal peoples.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe federal government responded to the RCAP recommendations through its Aboriginal action plan, Gathering Strength. In this plan the need for relevant and current data was recognized under the umbrella of developing a new fiscal relationship. Statistics Canada was mandated through Gathering Strength to coordinate a second Aboriginal Peoples Survey shortly after the 2001 Census.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary objective of the 2001 APS was to provide data on the social and economic conditions of Aboriginal people in Canada. More specifically, its purpose was to identify the needs of Aboriginal people and focus on issues such as health, language, employment, income, schooling, housing, and mobility. Indeed, there are large gaps in the data that presently exist for Aboriginal people. The 2001 APS was designed to address some of these gaps. This is information that cannot be found anywhere else and it can be used to answer a wide range of questions related to things like community planning, program development and health care priorities. Over 122,000 people were targeted for the 2001 survey and information on a broad range of topics is available.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PUMF should be used together with the data dictionary, which includes the survey questions, derived variables, and frequency distributions of all the variables.

expectations, to understand why such changes occur, and to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, borrow, or make discretionary purchases. The data regularly include the Index of Consumer Sentiment, the Index of Current Economic Conditions, and the Index of Consumer Expectations. Since the 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and monthly thereafter. The surveys conducted in 2009 focused on topics such as evaluations and expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Opinions were collected regarding respondents' appraisals of present market conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, and other durables. Also explored in this survey were respondents' types of savings and financial investments, loan use, family income, retirement planning, and mortgages.

HIV-related stigma impacts the quality of life of all persons with HIV/AIDS. However, little is known about HIV-related stigma in older adults because many studies do not include older subjects or ignore age as a variable. This mixed methods study examined the experiences of HIV-related stigma in a sample of 25 older adults with HIV/AIDS from the Pacific Northwest. Quantitative methods measured HIV stigma and depression, while in-depth qualitative interviews captured the lived experiences of these individuals. Stigma was positively and significantly correlated with depression and stigma was found to be significantly higher in African American, as compared to White informants. Qualitative interviews yielded 11 themes that correspond to the four categories constructed in the stigma instrument. Rejection, disclosure concerns, stereotyping, protective silence and feeling \"other\", were all common experiences of these individuals.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of HIV stigma in a population of older, HIV-infected adults.

Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate).

The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada.

Records of offenders who exit federal prison temporarily, such as for transit to another location, to serve a weekend sentence, or for health care, are not included in the exiting cohort. These data include variables that describe the offender, such as age, race, citizenship, as well as variables that describe the sentences and expected prison terms. The data file contains original variables from the Bureau of Prisons' SENTRY database, as well as \"SAF\" variables that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 7.9-7.16.

To fill\nthis research gap, this project created a data series on homicides per\ncapita for New York City that spans two centuries. The goal was to\ncreate a site-specific, individual-based data series that could be\nused to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such as mass\nimmigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and changes in\nlaws. Data were also gathered on various other sites, particularly in\nEngland, to allow for comparisons on important issues, such as the\npost-World War II wave of violence. The basic approach to the data\ncollection was to obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts\nand the most complete information on individual homicides. The annual\ncount data (Parts 1 and 3) were derived from multiple sources,\nincluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports\nand Supplementary Homicide Reports, as well as other official counts\nfrom the New York City Police Department and the City Inspector in the\nearly 19th century.

The\n goal was to create a site-specific, individual-based data series that\n could be used to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such\n as mass immigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and\n changes in laws. The researcher chose to focus on a specific\n geographic area because the composite national data did not provide\n the details needed for careful analysis. Data were also gathered on\n various other sites, particularly in England, to allow for comparisons\non important issues, such as the post-World War II wave of violence.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The basic approach to the data collection was to\n obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts and the most\n complete information on individual homicides. The annual count data\n (Parts 1 and 3) were derived from multiple sources, including the\n Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports and\n Supplementary Homicide Reports, as well as other official counts from\n the New York City Police Department and the City Inspector in the\n early 19th century. When there were discrepancies among sources, the\n principal investigator used the source giving the higher count, based\n on the assumption that missing information tends to bias toward an\n undercount. The data include a combined count of murder and\n manslaughter because charge bargaining often blurs this legal\n distinction. The following incidents were excluded from the counts:\n accidental homicides, infanticides, cases involving children under 5\n except when evidence in individual cases made it clear that these were\n murders, women who died during the course of an abortion, riot\n victims, the killing of an offender during the course of an arrest,\n and legal executions. The individual-level data (Part 2) were drawn\n from coroners' indictments held by the New York City Municipal\n Archives, and from daily newspapers.

Data is presented here for seaweed cover (%), understory cover (%) and invertebrate density for two sites on Wizard Islet. The third site located at the mouth of Grappler Inlet is discussed in the study report.\r\n<p/>\r\nWizard Islet (48°51’29.5”N, 125°09’31”W) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).\r\n<p/>\r\nAt both sites, a line of numbered tags spaced at 1m intervals at the same tidal height was installed. The tags denote the upper origin for 50 vertical transects. Fifteen tag numbers were chosen randomly, and transects were extended from the tags to the water. At the sheltered site, the tag numbers were 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 28, 35, 36, 40, 42, 48, 49. At the exposed site, they were 4, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 23, 26, 31, 32, 36, 42, 44, 45, 49.\r\n<p/>\r\nSampling was done at tidal heights 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5m. To maintain consistency, all quadrats were positioned to the left and above each point on the transect (when facing away from the water).\r\n<p/>\r\nAlgal canopy cover (%) which includes seaweeds and one grass was estimated using a 25x25cm quadrat divided into 100 squares or 1%. A square was counted if it contained &gt;=50% canopy cover. If a species was present but &lt;50%, abundance was recorded as 0.5%.\r\n<p/>\r\nUnderstory species cover (%) which includes algal species, encrusting invertebrates and rocks was estimated using the point intercept method for 20 random points in a 25x25cm quadrat of 100 squares. Since 20 of 100 possible intersections were marked, each point represented 5%. Each point could contain multiple organisms (layers), e.g. Balanus growing on Mytilus.\r\n<p/>\r\nInvertebrates were counted if &gt;=50% of the organism occurred within the quadrat. Quadrat size depended on the density of the organism (e.g. 12.5x12.5cm for Littorina, 25x25cm for Hemigrapsus, 50x50cm for Pisaster).\r\n<p/>\r\nData was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Tom Berman with Teaching Assistant Russ Markel July 21-Aug 29, 1997.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Cowan, Janet E.; Herman, Tom; Leonard, Karen; Markel, Russ; Oliver, Kathryn; Repard, Dora; Shapiro, Judith; Shubs, Shana, 2019, \"Replication data for: Barkley Sound intertidal long-term monitoring: rocky substrate methodology\", https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/PGCBPL, Scholars Portal Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:zFDD4TFTLQDi3N4mrQzTUA== [fileUNF]","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Acadia University","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Cowan, Janet E.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Herman, Tom","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Leonard, Karen","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Markel, Russ","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Oliver, Kathryn","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Repard, Dora","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Shapiro, Judith","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Shubs, Shana","metadata-type":"element"},{"prodPlac":"Bamfield, British Columbia, Canada","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"earth and environmental sciences","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"invertebrates","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"seaweeds","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"long term monitoring","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"barkley sound","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"wizard islet","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"rocky intertidal habitat","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"wave exposure","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"tidal height","metadata-type":"element"},{"producer":"Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"prodDate":"1997","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"SE-facet":"Wizard Islet long-term monitoring","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"1997","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Replication data for: Barkley Sound intertidal long-term monitoring: rocky substrate methodology","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":540,"uri":"/icpsr/24864.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F24864.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Simmons"}," ",{"highlight":"Longitudinal"}," ",{"highlight":"Study"},": ",{"highlight":"Adaptation"}," ",{"highlight":"and"}," ",{"highlight":"Development"}," ",{"highlight":"Across"}," ",{"highlight":"the"}," ",{"highlight":"Lifespan"}," [",{"highlight":"New"}," ",{"highlight":"England"},", ",{"highlight":"United"}," ",{"highlight":"States"},"], ",{"highlight":"Grade"}," ",{"highlight":"12"}," ",{"highlight":"Data"},", ",{"highlight":"Wave"}," ",{"highlight":"5"},", ",{"highlight":"1990"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":[{"highlight":"24864"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:syear","match-text":[{"highlight":"1990"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:slang","match-text":[{"highlight":"en"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/24864.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/prodStmt/producer","match-text":["\n                        ",{"highlight":"Inter"},"-",{"highlight":"university"}," ",{"highlight":"Consortium"}," "]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"The Simmons Longitudinal Study (SLS) is a community-based study that has prospectively traced the life course of a single-aged cohort from childhood (age 5) to adulthood (age 26).

Since its inception in 1977, the SLS has utilized a multidisciplinary, multimethod approach, with the dual goals of: (1) tracing the development and course of academic difficulties, behavior problems, and psychopathology; and (2) identifying factors that promote health functioning from early childhood (age 5) to adulthood (age 26). The SLS has consistently emphasized the identification of modifiable social and environmental risk and protective factors that can be targeted directly in prevention and intervention programs. To date, SLS has published 50 journal articles and 9 book chapters. The original study group was comprised of every child who entered kindergarten in the fall of 1977 in one public school district in a northeastern town in the United States. For this wave of the study, Wave 5, researchers revisited with study participants in 1990 when they were 18 years old and most were seniors in high school thinking about future plans for work and education. The interviews gathered information on future goals, behavioral and emotional adjustment, current social and interpersonal functioning, and mental health problems such as depression, and substance abuse and dependence.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Reinherz, Helen Z.

It provides a meaningful picture of who does or does not have access to EI benefits among the jobless and those in a situation of underemployment. The Employment Insurance Coverage Survey also covers access to maternity and parental benefits. </p>\n\nThe survey was designed to produce a series of precise measures to identify groups with low probability of receiving benefits, for instance, the long-term jobless, labour market entrants and students, people becoming unemployed after uninsured employment, people who have left jobs voluntarily and individuals who are eligible, given their employment history, but do not claim or otherwise receive benefits. The survey provides a detailed description of the characteristics of the last job held as well as reasons for not receiving benefits or for not claiming. </p>\n\nThrough the survey data, analysts will also be able to observe the characteristics and situation of people not covered by EI and of those who exhausted EI benefits, the job search intensity of the unemployed, expectation of recall to a job, and alternate sources of income and funds. </p>\n\nSurvey data pertaining to maternity and parental benefits answer questions on the proportion of mothers of an infant who received maternity and parental benefits, the reason why some mothers do not receive benefits and about sharing parental benefits with their spouse. The survey also allows looking at the timing and circumstances related to the return to work, the income adequacy of households with young children and more.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2008.

The respondents were also asked to identify cultural values\nfor Europe as well as other countries, about the importance and\npromotion of cultural exchange, and whether they would learn a foreign\nlanguage. For the next major focus, respondents were asked to evaluate\ntheir personal financial situation and that of people dwelling in the\nvicinity of their homes, and to ascertain why people fall into poverty\nor are excluded from society. They were also asked why people become\nhomeless, the likelihood that they, themselves, would become homeless,\nand whether they help the homeless. Respondents were further asked to\nevaluate their quality of life and to determine their needs in\nattaining decent living conditions for themselves and for\nchildren. For the third major focus, respondents were asked to\nevaluate their knowledge of developmental aid plans, the European\nConsensus on Development, and the Millennium Development\nGoals. Respondents were asked to identify the motivation of countries\nproviding developmental aid, and the added value of the European Union (EU) in doing\nso. In addition, respondents shared their opinions as to which\norganizations should have the most influence on the priorities for\ndevelopmental aid, and which countries and issues should be\nacknowledged as needing the most attention and assistance.  The final\nmajor focus pertained to residential mobility. The survey queried\nrespondents about their relocation history, reasons for moving or not\nmoving, countries to which they intended to move, preparing for a move\n(including difficulties they may encounter), and the duration of their\nstay at a location.

In the late 1970s, the law\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\nare archived at ICPSR as 11 separate data files per year, which may be\nmerged by using linkage variables. Prior to 2013 the data were archived and distributed as 13 separate data files, including three separate batch header record files. Starting with the 2013 data, the FBI combined the three batch header files into one file. Consequently, ICPSR instituted new file numbering for the data. NIBRS data focus on a variety of\naspects of a crime incident. Part 2 (formerly Part 4), Administrative Segment, offers\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\nPart 3 (formerly Part 5), Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\nmotivation), Part 4 (formerly Part 6), Property Segment (type of property loss, property\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 5 (formerly Part 7), Victim\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 6 (formerly Part 8), Offender\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 7 (formerly Part 9), Arrestee Segment (arrest\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Part 1, formerly Parts\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 8 (formerly Part 10), Group B\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\nWindow Segments files (Parts 9-11, formerly Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\ncomplete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\ngeneral, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\noccurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\noccurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\nUCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\ncrime in the United States.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"n/a","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system which means data are collected\non each single crime occurrence.  NIBRS data are designed to be generated\nas a by-product of local, State, and Federal automated records management\nsystems. Thus, an agency can build its own system to suit its individual\nneeds, including all the information required for administrative and\noperational purposes. Only the data required by NIBRS are then reported to\nthe national UCR Program.\nNIBRS collects data on each single incident and arrest within 22 offense\ncategories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. For each of the offenses coming to the attention of law\nenforcement, various facts about the crime are collected. In addition to\nthe Group A offenses, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported.\nCentral to NIBRS is the concept of a crime incident. An incident is defined\nfor NIBRS reporting purposes as one or more offenses committed by the same\noffender, or group of offenders acting in concert, at the same time and\nplace. \"Acting in concert\" requires that the offenders actually commit or\nassist in the commission of the crime(s). The offenders must be aware of,\nand consent to, the commission of the crime(s); or even if nonconsenting,\ntheir actions assist in the commission of the offense(s). This is important\nbecause all of the offenders in an incident are considered to have\ncommitted all of the offenses in the incident. If one or more of the\noffenders did not act in concert, then there is more than one incident\ninvolved.\nThe phrase \"same time and place\" means that the time interval between\nthe offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred\nwere insignificant. Normally, the offenses must have occurred during an\nunbroken period of time and at the same or adjoining location(s). However,\nincidents can also consist of offenses which by their nature involve\ncontinuing criminal activity by the same offender(s) at different times and\nplaces, as long as the activity is deemed to constitute a single criminal\ntransaction.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

Des études et des rapports récents sur certains segments de la fonction publique fédérale ont révélé que le découragement était répandu chez les cadres et les travailleurs intellectuels et que, de l'avis de nombreux employés, le milieu de travail ne les incitait pas à avoir confiance dans les gestionnaires, et ne favorisait pas la satisfaction et l'avancement professionnels.

It was\n designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of\n both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the\n project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,\n adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the\n project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these\n social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data\n about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and\n resources.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which\n was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over\n 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and\n their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing\n circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,\n that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial\n behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18\n years. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to gauge\n various aspects of human development, including individual\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences.\n My Exposure to Violence (Subject and Young Adult)\n The data in this collection are from Wave 3 of the Longitudinal\n Cohort Study, which was administered between 2000 and 2002.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data\n collection, 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection, and\n 4,850 were interviewed in the Wave 3 data collection.\n Data collection for Wave 3 began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It\n included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they\n would be contacted to schedule an interview. Additional information on\n the contact log included the dates and research assistant ID of the\n Wave 2 interview (or the status of the case if incomplete in Wave 2),\n a list of household composition and ID numbers of other household\n members in the study, the name the telephone was listed under, the\n recontact information from Waves 1 and 2, and an updated history of\n addresses.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated\n telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in\n Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 3 who lived\n outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants\n were able to travel for interviews. In Wave 3, phone interviews were\n also conducted with the study participants in Cohort 15. People who\n refused to complete the two-hour in-person interview were administered\n the phone interview. A total of 391 telephone interviews were\n conducted during Wave 3, representing 6.3 percent of the sample.\n Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were\n emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The\n study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's\n interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 3, one primary\n caregiver and eleven study participants (young adults) were\n interviewed in jail. They were located in either the Cook County Jail\n or in one of the state prisons. Those study participants in a state\n system outside the nine-county area were also interviewed by\n phone. Study participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The\n Department of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of\n the foster parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief\n period in Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who\n could not be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in\n foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or\n 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were\n interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care\n during Wave 2. Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language\n other than English, Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 3, an abbreviated\n version of the primary caregiver's protocol was administered, and the\n research assistant arranged for someone in the household to translate\n on the spot. In Wave 3, the complete protocol was translated into\n Spanish.\n Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were\n paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free\n passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also\n included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n For primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an\n addendum interview was administered consisting of measures or portions\n of measures from the Wave 2 interview. An addendum was also given to\n the Cohort 15 and 18 study participants who were not included in Wave\n 2. A total of 164 primary caregivers and 62 young adult (Cohorts 15\n and 18) addendums were completed in Wave 3.\n My Exposure to Violence (Subject and Young Adult)\n The My Exposure to Violence (Subject and Young Adult) instrument\n was administered to Cohorts 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 and obtained\n information regarding the subject's lifetime and past-year exposure to\n violent events.

Its purpose is to track how the attitudes of Canadians have evolved on a range of issues relating to the nature and well-being of the federation, its institutions and its citizens. </P> <P> For eight years, the Canadian Unity Council's Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC) has conducted <i> Portraits of Canada </i>, an annual national surve\ny of Canadians' opinions about government, each other and the country's future.\n<i> Portraits </i> is more than a poll; it is a vehicle to start a conversation with Canadians. We want to hear what they have to say - what you have to say - about what is going on and what the future holds. This in keeping with the CRIC's mandate to inform and to engage all Canadians in building and strengthening Canada. </P>  <P> In the 2005 edition of <i> Portraits </i>, we once again track how Canadians' attitudes have evolved on a range of issues relating to the nature and well-being of th\ne country. Some of the questions that we have asked this year include:\n</P>  <P>- Do they consider a balanced budget as all that important? </P> <P>- How do they rate  their leaders?</P>  <P>- How do they feel about minority government?</P> <P>- Are they prepared to make trade-offs on civil liberties to ensure their security?</P> <P>Every year <i> Portraits </i> asks roughly 50 questions, a significant proportion of which have been asked in the past. This allows us to track which views are changing with time and which remain fairly constant. The sample size of our\nsurvey is large. Quite often the polls that you see in the news have about 1,000 respondents throughout Canada. By contrast, our sample of 3,201 Canadians is large enough to ensure that opinions in all regions of the country, including the three Northern Territories, are accurately reflected. Two separate surveys are carried out, one in Quebec (conducted by CROP) and one in the rest of Canada (conducted by Environics Research Group). The results are then combined. The survey's Quebec component was conducted September 13-26, 2005. As with any survey, there is a margin of error. In this case it is plus or minus 1.7%, 95% of the time.\n</P> <p>Once the information is analyzed and released at a major news conference, Council staff and supporters fan out across the country to present the results to groups ranging from young leaders, community groups, Rotary Clubs, high school, and university students to business associations, municipal, provincial, and federal officials, as well as politicians.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

The\nlegislation was in response to growing public concern regarding\nincidents of violence and vandalism occurring in the nation's\nschools. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency\nand seriousness of crime in elementary and secondary schools in the\nUnited States, the number and location of schools affected by crime,\nthe cost of replacement or repair of objects damaged by school crime,\nand possible methods of prevention. The legislation specified that the\nstudy was to be conducted by the National Institute of Education\n(NIE). The NIE designed the study in three phases, and data collection\nwas carried out by the Research Triangle Institute, with computer work\nsupervised by Sheldon Laube of C.M. Leinwand Associates. The primary\ndata for the study were collected in two concurrent sample surveys:\nPhase I and Phase II. Phase I, a mail survey, asked more than 4,000\nelementary and secondary school principals to report in detail on the\nincidence of illegal or disruptive activities in their schools. Nine\none-month reporting periods between February 1976 and January 1977,\nexcluding summer months, were assigned to participating schools on a\nrandom basis. Parts 2 and 11 contain data gathered from school\nprincipals in this phase. In Phase II, field representatives conducted\non-site and follow-up surveys of junior and senior high school\nstudents and teachers in public secondary schools. They were asked to\nreport any experiences they might have had as victims of violence or\ntheft in the reporting month. In addition, they provided information\nabout themselves, their schools, and their communities. Also, the\nprincipals in this sample were asked to keep a record of incidents\nduring the reporting month, including robberies, attacks, and\nthefts. They also supplied information about their schools'\ncharacteristics and crime prevention methods. Parts 7, 16, 19, 24, 29,\n30, 35, 39, 43, and 47 contain the data gathered in this phase. Part\n18 contains the combined data gathered in the Principal\nquestionnaires, utilizing both Phase I and Phase II samples. Part 51\nis a file created to supply community information about each Phase II\nschool. Most of its information was extracted from the 1970 Census,\nbut it also includes weather and unemployment data. Phase III involved\na more intensive qualitative study of 10 schools, most which had had a\nhistory of problems with crime and violence, but which had improved\ndramatically in a short time. Some crimes explored were vandalism,\ntheft, personal violence, and verbal abuse. The place of occurrence\nand characteristics of each offender were also examined.

In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF variables,\" that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 4.1-4.5 and 5.1-5.6. Variables containing information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Justice. Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and\n opinions about the 2000 presidential election. Respondents were asked\n to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of\n the presidency, as well as their opinions of both candidates, Vice\n President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush. Those polled were\n asked whether Bush and Gore would be able to lead the country\n effectively and whether they would bring together or divide different\n groups of Americans. The survey also queried respondents on the\n legitimacy of the election, the way the Bush and Gore campaigns\n handled the election, the way elections in the United States are run\n and votes are counted, the need for election reforms, the electoral\n college, and the effects of the election controversy on the\n institution of the United States presidency. A number of questions\n concentrated on Florida's vote recount. Those polled were asked whom\n voters in Florida intended to vote for and whether the vote count in\n Florida was fair and accurate. Respondents also commented on the way\n the courts had handled the lawsuits dealing with the Florida vote, the\n manual recounts of disputed votes in Florida, and the manual recounts\n of all ballots in Florida. Their views were elicited on whom they\n would rather see become president, how much confidence they had in the\n vote counting, what voting method they used, when they thought the\n outcome would finally be resolved, whether one of the candidates\n should concede, and if so, who, and whether they approved of the\n legislature naming its electors before the outcome had been\n determined.

Specifically, respondents were asked what activities they\n participated in, how many hours they spent watching television, how\n many hours they spent at their home computer, and whether they planned\n their activities in advance. Those surveyed were also asked about\n their source of information for things happening on the weekend, how\n often they went into Washington, DC itself, and if not very often,\n why. The survey also queried whether respondents had avoided\n attending any events after September 11, 2001, due to concerns over\n terrorist attacks.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n\n<p><strong>Notes: </strong>Révision de l'<strong>Enquête sur la population active (EPA)</strong>: Les estimations de l'EPA étaient auparavant basées sur les estimations de la population du Recensement de 2006. Dorénavant, les données de l'EPA ont été rétroactivement ajustées jusqu'en 2001, pour refléter les estimations de la population du <strong>Recensement de 2011</strong>.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2014.

Currently married women were queried on the\nfollowing main topics: residence history, marital history, education,\nincome and employment, family background, religiosity, attitudes\ntoward contraception and sterilization, birth control pill use and\nother methods of contraception, fecundity, family size, fertility\nexpectations and intentions, abortion, and world population growth.\nRespondents were asked about their residence history, including what\nstate they grew up in, whether they had lived with both of their\nparents at the age of 14, and whether they had spent any time living\non a farm. Respondents were also asked a series of questions about\ntheir marital history. Specifically, they were asked about the\nduration of their current marriage, whether their current marriage was\ntheir first marriage, total number of times they had been married, how\nprevious marriages ended, length of engagement, and whether their\nhusband had children from a previous marriage. Respondents were asked\nwhat was the highest grade of school that they had completed, whether\nthey had attended a co-ed college, and to give the same information\nabout their husbands. Respondents were asked about their 1965 income,\nboth individual and combined, their occupation, whether they had been\nemployed since marriage, if and when they stopped working, and whether\nthey were self-employed. They were also asked about their husband's\nrecent employment status. With respect to family background,\nrespondents were asked about their parents' and their husband's\nparents' nationalities, education, religious preferences, and total\nnumber children born alive to their mother and mother-in-law,\nrespectively. In addition, respondents were asked about their, and\ntheir husband's, religious practices including their religious\npreferences, whether they had ever received any Catholic education,\nhow religious-minded they perceived themselves to be, how often they\nprayed at home, and how often they went to see a minister, rabbi, or\npriest. Respondents were asked to give their opinions with respect to\ncontraception and sterilization. They were asked whether they\napproved or disapproved of contraception in general, as well as\nspecific forms of contraception, whether information about birth\ncontrol should be available to married and unmarried couples, and\nwhether the federal government should support birth control programs\nin the United States and in other countries. They were also asked\nwhether they approved or disapproved of sterilization operations for\nmen and women and whether they thought such a surgery would impair a\nman's sexual ability. Respondents were asked about their own\nknowledge and use of birth control pills. They were asked if they had\never used birth control pills and when they first began using\nthem. They were then asked to give a detailed account of their use of\nbirth control pills between 1960 and 1965. Respondents were also asked\nto explain when they discontinued use of birth control pills and what\nthe motivation was for doing so. Respondents were also asked about\ntheir reproductive cycle, the most fertile days in their cycle, the\nregularity of their cycle, and whether there were any known reasons\nwhy they could not have or would have problems having children.\nRespondents were asked about their ideal number of children, whether\nthey had their ideal number of children or if they really wanted fewer\nchildren, as well as whether their husbands wanted more or less\nchildren than they did. Respondents were then asked how many\nadditional births they expected, how many total births they expected,\nwhen they expected their next child, and at what age they expected to\nhave their last child. Respondents were asked how they felt about\ninterrupting a pregnancy and whether they approved of abortion given\ndifferent circumstances such as if the pregnancy endangered the\nwoman's health, if the woman was not married, if the couple could not\nafford another child, if the couple did not want another child, if the\nwoman thought the child would be deformed, or if the woman had been\nraped. Respondents were also asked to share their opinions with\nrespect to world population growth. They were asked whether certain\ncountries' populations were growing faster or slower than the United\nStates, if they considered overall world population growth to be a\nserious problem, and how serious the problem of population growth,\nboth in the United States and worldwide, was relative to other\nproblems such as poverty and crime. The survey also included a\nthorough review of all of the respondents' pregnancies and their\noutcomes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Westoff, Charles F., and Norman B. Ryder.

experienced by individuals over time. At the heart of the survey's objectives is the understanding of the economic well-being of Canadians: what economic shifts do individuals and families live through, and how does it vary with changes in their paid work, family make-up, receipt of government transfers or other factors? The survey's longitudinal dimension makes it possible to see such concurrent and often related events.\n<br>\nSLID is the first Canadian household survey to provide national data on the fluctuations in income that a typical family or individual experiences over time which gives greater insight on the nature and extent of poverty in Canada. Added to the longitudinal aspect are the \"traditional\" cross-sectional data: the primary Canadian source for income data and providing additional content to data collected by the Labour Force Survey (LFS).\n<br>\nParticularly in SLID, the focus extends from static measures (cross-sectional) to the whole range of transitions, durations, and repeat occurrences (longitudinal) of people's financial and work situations. Since their family situation, education, and demographic background may play a role, the survey has extensive information on these topics as well.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada, Data Liberation Initiative. 2010.

Other questions probed partisan self-identification and the\n extent of political participation. The respondents' knowledge of\n members of parliament from their constituencies, and perceptions of\n social class and trade-union influence were also\n investigated.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data\n collection and 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data\n collection.\n Data collection for Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It\n included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they\n would be contacted to schedule an interview. This letter explained the\n study, reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000\n for those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A\n toll free number was also included in the letter, so participants\n could call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated\n telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in\n Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived\n outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants\n were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone\n interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of\n the sample.\n Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were\n emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The\n study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's\n interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 2, four primary\n caregivers and two study participants were interviewed in jail. Study\n participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The Department\n of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of the foster\n parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief period in\n Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who could not\n be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in foster care\n in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were\n also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were interviewed in\n Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care during Wave 2.\n Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary\n caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant\n arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In\n Wave 2, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish, and a subset\n of the primary caregiver's interview was translated into Polish.\n Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were\n paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free\n passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also\n included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Subject)\n The subject version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder instrument\n was administered to subjects in Cohorts 9, 12, and 15.

The key features which characterized \n \n the 1975 time use study were repeated in 1981.

Information pertaining to the household was collected, \n \n as well as identical measures from respondents and spouses for all \n \n person-specific information. Selected children provided two time diary \n \n reports (one for a school day and one non-school day), an academic \n \n achievement measure, and survey measures pertaining to school and \n \n family life. In addition, teacher ratings were obtained. For each adult \n \n individual who remained in the sample through the 1981 study, a time \n \n budget was constructed from his or her time diaries containing the \n \n number of minutes per week spent in each of some 223 mutually exclusive \n \n and exhaustive activities. These measures provide a description of how \n \n the sample individuals were currently allocating their time and are \n \n comparable to the 87 activity measures created from their 1975 diaries. \n \n In addition, respondent and spouse time aggregates were converted to \n \n parent time aggregates for mothers and fathers of children in the \n \n sample. To facilitate analyses on spouses, a merged data file was \n \n created for 868 couples in which both husband and wife had complete \n \nWave I data in either 1975-1976 or 1981.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Juster, F.

Respondents were queried on what they missed most about being a child, what was their biggest Internet-related worry, whether they or someone in the household had made any contributions or donations to assist the victims of the earthquake in Haiti, whether they have contributed or donated to any other charities in the past year, whether they donate to charities because they feel they should do it or because they want to help those in need, whether they would like to donate more to charities, whether they mostly donate to charities and organizations in the United States or around the world, and whether they think that people have a moral responsibility to give what they can to help those in need. Respondents were also asked whether they had any siblings, how close they were to their siblings, how close they were with their siblings when they were growing up, whether they were equally close with every siblings or had some siblings that they were closer with, whether they had ever completely stopped talking with a sibling and how long it lasted, whether they ever felt competitive with their siblings and how often, whether their parents treated all the children equally or had favorites, and how often they see their siblings in person. Information was collected on which president the respondent admired most, whether they thought that the founding fathers would be pleased with the way America turned out if they came back to the present day, whether they had taken or planned on taking a winter vacation trip, whether they would marry their current spouse if they had to do it all over again, whether they believed in love at first sight, and what they thought was the most important ingredient for a successful romantic relationship. Finally, respondents were asked whether they believed that there is intelligent life on other planets, whether they believed there is non-intelligent life, such as microbes and bacteria, that exist somewhere in the universe, and whether they thought that we will have conclusive scientific proof of life elsewhere in the universe within the next twenty years.

Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the EU, including how well-informed they felt about the EU, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member, and the extent of their personal interest in EU matters. Other major areas of focus in the surveys included European Parliament elections, the single European currency (the euro), and respondents' experiences with financial services. Respondents were asked which television news programs they watched, which newspaper(s) they read, and how much attention they gave to politics, social issues, the European Union, the economy, sports, the environment, foreign policy, and culture. They were also asked whether they voted in the most recent European Parliament elections, what their reasons were for voting or not voting, and how they viewed the importance and power of the European Parliament in the European Union. A number of questions probed for respondents' knowledge and use\nof the euro, whether they worried about changing to the euro, and what they thought about the timing of the change to the euro and about legislation surrounding the euro. Another set of questions queried respondents about financial services and obstacles to using those services, means of payment for important purchases, bank accounts, post office accounts, loans, and mortgages. Standard demographic information was collected on left-right political self-placement, marital status, age at completion of education, current age, sex,\nnumber of people in the household, number of children in the household, current occupation, previous occupation, household income,size of locality, and region of residence.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Melich, Anna.

The birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-B) looks at children's health, development, care, and education during the formative years from birth through first grade.\nThis third wave of the data was collected when the cohort was preschool aged. For the preschool collection, the ECLS-B child assessment protocol was modified to take into account the study children's growing competencies and to focus more on indicators of school readiness. The BSF-R was replaced with an early reading and mathematics assessment similar to the assessments used in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) kindergarten and first grade collections. Unique to the preschool wave was the assessment of children's knowledge of basic colors. Fine motor skills were assessed by asking children to copy a series of forms/shapes drawn by assessors and to build structures using blocks. Gross motor skills were assessed by asking children to jump, balance on one foot, hop on one foot, skip, walk backward along a line, and catch a bean bag. Additionally, as in the previous waves, children's social interactions with the parent respondent were assessed using the Two Bags Task. All children had their height, weight, and middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measured, and children born with very low birth weight had their head circumference measured.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"United States Department of Education.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Health and Human Services.

Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1993.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.\n\nThe Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.\n\nLFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2014.

It is the only national statistical collection that obtains detailed information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. The DCRP collects data on persons dying in state prisons, local jails and in the process of arrest. Each collection is a separate subcollection, but each is under the umbrella of the DCRP collection. The DCRP collects inmate death records from each of the nation's 50 state prison systems and approximately 2,800 local jail jurisdictions. In addition, this program collects records of all deaths occurring during the process of arrest. Data are collected directly from state and local law enforcement agencies.\nDeath records include information on decedent personal characteristics (age, race or Hispanic origin, and sex), decedent criminal background (legal status, offense type, and time served), and the death itself (date, time, location, and cause of death, as well as information on the autopsy and medical treatment provided for any illness or disease).\nThis data collection represents a single year of DCRP Jails data. The variable names and coding, while similar to other years, have not been standardized across years.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

Il permet d’évaluer les effets qu’a le système fiscal et de transferts d’argent sur les coûts et la redistribution du revenu.</p>\n\n<p>La BD/MSPS compte quatre éléments fondamentaux : une base de données (la BDSPS), un modèle (le MSPS qui comprend un ensemble d’algorithmes de simulation), les logiciels d’extraction de données et d’établissement de rapports sur les données ainsi que la documentation d’utilisation.</p>\n\n<p>1. La BDSPS est une base de données statistiques représentatives et non confidentielles des individus dans le contexte de leur famille, avec suffisamment d’information sur chaque individu pour permettre le calcul des taxes et impôts payés au gouvernement ainsi que des montants remis par les gouvernements.\n<br>2. Le MSPS est un modèle comptable statique qui fait le traitement de chaque individu et de chaque famille qu’il y a dans la BDSPS, calcule les taxes et impôts ainsi que les transferts avec des algorithmes qui simulent les programmes adoptés ou proposés, et établit des rapports sur les résultats. Un environnement logiciel perfectionné donne à l’utilisateur beaucoup d’influence sur les entrées et les sorties du modèle et lui permet de modifier les programmes existants ou d’examiner des projets entièrement nouveaux. À l’intérieur du MSPS, il y a deux modèles configurés comme deux programmes informatiques distincts.\n<br>2a. Le programme central, le MSPS, est un modèle de microsimulation qui calcule les taxes, les impôts et les transferts pour les individus et les familles. Ces calculs sont exécutés pour quiconque se trouve dans la BDSPS et les résultats sont alors agrégés de façon à produire des estimations. Le MSPS est un modèle d’incidence statique et il ne vise pas à simuler la façon dont le comportement d’un individu est susceptible de changer en réaction à diverses options de politique. Le MSPS comprend le logiciel qui permet à l’utilisateur d’exécuter des opérations de totalisation et d’extraction de l’information contenue dans la base de données.\n<br>2b. Le modèle de taxe à la consommation (COMTAX) est un modèle reposant sur des données d’entrées-sorties de macro-économique. Ce modèle ne fait pas partie du progiciel BD/MSPS dans sa version actuelle, mais ce sont les résultats obtenus avec lui qui en font partie. COMTAX donne une estimation des taxes de vente fédérales et provinciales ainsi que des taxes à la consommation équivalentes par province, par ménage, par catégorie de dépenses et par type de taxe. Ce modèle est nécessaire parce que de nombreuses taxes à la consommation sont prélevées à diverses étapes de la production et non à l’étape de la vente au détail. Les taux calculés par le modèle COMTAX peuvent être utilisés comme paramètres à l’entrée du MSPS afin de produire des estimations des taxes à la consommation payées, directement et indirectement, par tout ménage donné.\n<br>3. Les logiciels d’extraction de données et d’établissement de rapports sont configurés comme fonctions auxquelles on a accès par le modèle. Ils permettent à l’utilisateur de produire des données de sortie mises en forme et d’exécuter certains genres d’analyse en particulier.\n<br>4. La documentation d’utilisation est volumineuse et complète. Elle est répartie en trois manuels contenant un certain nombre de guides.</p>\n\n<p>Il y a également deux manières d’exécuter le MSPS : en utilisant l’interface du MSPS Visuel ou le mode MSPS Classique.\n<br>1. MSPS Visuel : L’interface du MSPS Visuel permet aux utilisateurs de modifier les paramètres du modèle, d’exécuter les simulations avec le MSPS et d’examiner les sorties.\n<br>2.

Recidivism was\n measured by rearrest for a new crime. These interviews were\n supplemented with administrative records data that provided background\n information about the sample. In addition, administrative data were\n collected on all juveniles sentenced to intensive supervision during\n fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to compare juveniles in the sample with all\njuveniles on probation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"In Part 1, Pre- and Post-Test Data, variables\n include cognitive measures such as impulsivity, problem-solving\n ability, egocentricity, and cognitive style.

Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.\n\nLFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. \n\nThese data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region.

The National Crime Victimization Survey, Concatenated File, [United States], 1992-2016: Revised Version (ICPSR 37241) data collection contains the official 1992-2016 NCVS data and replaces the previously published National Crime Victimization Survey, Concatenated File, [United States], 1992-2016 (ICPSR 36834) Public-Use Files. The initial files remain available for research purposes.\nThe National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously called the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2016. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 36828.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

Since the 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and monthly thereafter. The surveys conducted in 2006 focused on topics such as evaluations and expectations about personal finances, mortgages, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Opinions were collected regarding respondents' appraisals of present market conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, and other durables. Also explored in this survey were respondents' types of savings and financial investments, loan use, family income, general feelings, and retirement planning. Other topics in this series typically include ownership, lease, and use of automobiles, respondents' use of personal computers at home and in the office, respondents' familiarity with and use of the Internet, and political affiliation.

Additional questions focused on the  respondents' knowledge of and opinions about the European Union,  including how well informed they felt about the EU, what sources of  information about the EU they used, and whether their country had benefited from being an EU member. Other variables included  respondents' expectations regarding employment, and their present and  future economic and financial situation. Opinions regarding various  European institutions, such as the European Parliament, the European  Central Bank, and the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union were elicited. Respondents were asked whether issues such as defense, currency, and cultural policy should be handled by the nation's government or jointly with the EU, and whether issues such as\nwelcoming new member countries, protecting the environment, or fighting terrorism were priorities the EU should undertake. Respondents were asked whether it was a good thing that the euro replaced their national currency, how comfortable they felt using the euro, to what degree they were attached to the single currency, whether they still felt a personal attachment to their previous\ncurrency, whether they felt that in the conversion to the euro, prices had generally been rounded down, rounded up, or not rounded at all, and whether they felt this was the case in all areas or only in certain areas. Respondents were further queried on their views regarding the EU enlargement. Specifically, respondents were asked how informed they were about the EU enlargement, whether they had read, seen, or been told about the enlargement via various media such as radio, newspapers, television, the Internet, books, brochures, or national or regional government offices, whether they were in favor of or opposed to particular countries joining the EU, their preferred option for the immediate future of the EU with regard to the enlargement (i.e., whether the EU should include all, some, or none of the countries wishing to join), whether certain groups (small or large businesses, the elderly, and ethnic minorities) would benefit or lose out as a result of enlargement, and whether they agreed or disagreed with statements regarding the EU enlargement (e.g., having more  countries in the EU will mean more guaranteed peace and security in Europe, the EU should financially help future member countries before they join, and the EU should reform the way its institutions work before welcoming new members). Questions regarding financial services probed for respondents' opinions on whether consumer protection standards should be harmonized within the EU, obstacles preventing consumers from using financial services in the EU, and what sort of feelings the respondent had when thinking about their finances and\nfinancial services (e.g., comforted or intimidated). Respondents were asked to identify their top three financial priorities, choosing from the following: paying bills, paying off debt, buying a house, providing financial security for family in the event of unemployment, and saving for emergencies or retirement. Respondents were also asked to provide information on whether they had a checkbook, credit cards, life insurance policy, car and other loans, mortgage, or stocks/shares, and whether they would consider obtaining any of these items from another country. The survey also collected information on respondents' preferred method of paying for significant purchases (e.g., with cash, check, credit card, or bank transfer) inside and outside of their own country, and the reasons for this payment preference. Finally, respondents indicated whether or not they agreed with a series of statements regarding financial institutions, such as (1) having a bank account is too expensive, (2) buying on credit is more useful than dangerous, (3) the marketing techniques of financial institutions are aggressive, (4) financial transactions are generally secure, and (5) transactions on the Internet are generally secure. Demographic and other background information collected includes respondents' age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of education, household income, type and size of locality, and region of residence.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Christensen, Thomas.

It examines the characteristics, well-being, and accomplishments of families, the observed quality of Head Start classrooms, and the characteristics and opinions of Head Start teachers and other program staff. FACES was designed to address four central questions related to program performance objectives:  Does Head Start enhance children's development and school readiness? Does Head Start strengthen families as the primary nurturers of their children? Does head Start provide children with high quality educational, health, and nutritional services? How is classroom quality related to child outcomes?  The FACES 2003 Cohort involved a nationally representative sample of children and families in Head Start programs in the United States who were studied at entry into the program in the fall of 2003, assessed at the completion of their program experience, and followed up at the end of their kindergarten year. The FACES 2003 battery has five main components: the child assessment, parent interview, teacher and staff interviews, classroom observations and teacher-child reports.  The child assessments included the major components of school readiness, and were collected through direct child assessments and rating scales completed by parents and teachers. Some of the direct child assessments included the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Third Edition-Revised (PPVT-III), Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, story and print concepts, social awareness, color names and one-to-one counting and assessor ratings. The parent interview was designed to provide Head Start with a comprehensive understanding of the families that they serve, including the characteristics of households and household members, levels and types of participation in the program and in other community services, involvement with their children, and an understanding of their children's development. In addition to this, parents were asked to rate each child on a set of behaviors that assessed the child's basic social skills and behavior problems. The teacher and staff interview was designed to provide information on Head Start personnel experience, education, and training as well as knowledge and beliefs about child development, and educational activities with children and parents. The classroom observations were designed to measure peer interactions, friendships of children, and the extent to which Head Start programs employed skilled teachers and provided developmentally appropriate environments and curricula for their children. Some of the assessments used included the Assessment Profile, Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R), classroom observation of teacher-directed activities, and the Arnett Caregiver Interaction Scale. The teacher-child report was designed to capture important sources of information about children's learning and behavior through the use of the Teacher-Child Report (TCR), social skills ratings, the Behavior Problems scale and the Preschool Learning Behavior Scale (PLBS).

Children were enrolled in the \n study at the time that social services personnel substantiated claims \n of sexual abuse, and they were followed for a period of 18 months. \n Assessments of the mental health functioning of the children were made \n at the time of initial investigation, five months later, and 18 months \n later, using a combination of self-reports, parent and teacher reports, \n and psychological tests. After obtaining informed consent from the \n parent or guardian, each child was interviewed using a structured \n psychiatric inventory. The specific impacts of the various judicial \n processes or interventions under study were examined through \n comparisons of subgroups of the sample that did and did not experience \n particular interventions. The interventions included social services \n investigation, court process, foster placement, and psychological \n therapy.

It is based on\n modeling customer evaluations of the quality of goods and services\n that are purchased in the United States and produced by both domestic\n and foreign firms that have substantial United States market shares.\n The ACSI model is a set of causal equations that link customer\n expectations, perceived quality, and perceived value to customer\n satisfaction. In turn, satisfaction is linked to consequences as\n defined by customer complaints and customer loyalty -- measured by\n price tolerance and customer retention. Customer expectations combine\n customers' experiences with a product or service and information about\n it via media, advertising, salespersons, and word-of-mouth. Customer\n expectations influence the evaluation of quality and forecast how well\n the product or service will perform. Perceived quality of a product or\n service is measured through questions on its overall quality,\n reliability, and the extent to which it meets the customer's needs.\n Perceived value is measured through questions on overall price given\n quality and overall quality given price. Customer complaints activity\n is measured as the percentage of respondents who reported a problem\n with the measured company's product or service within a specified time\n frame. Satisfaction has an inverse relationship to customer\n complaints. Customer loyalty is measured through questions on the\n likelihood that customers will purchase a company's products or\n services at various price points. The ACSI is produced through a\n partnership of the University of Michigan Business School, the\n American Society for Quality (ASQ), and the international consulting\n firm, CFI Group. Background variables include age, education, number\n of family members, Hispanic origin, race, household income, sex,\nindustry, and sector of the economy.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Fornell, Claes.

Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques.

The recent availability of comprehensive and detailed expression atlases for mouse and human creates opportunities to discover global patterns and perform cross-species comparisons. Recently we reported that the major source of variation in gene transcript expression in the adult normal mouse brain can be parsimoniously explained as reflecting regional variation in glia to neuron ratios, and is correlated with degree of connectivity and location in the brain along the anterior-posterior axis. Here we extend this investigation to two gene expression assays of adult normal human brains that consisted of over 300 brain region samples, and perform comparative analyses of brain-wide expression patterns to the mouse. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the regional gene expression of the adult human brain to identify the expression pattern that has the largest variance. As in the mouse, we observed that the first principal component is composed of two anti-correlated patterns enriched in oligodendrocyte and neuron markers respectively. However, we also observed interesting discordant patterns between the two species. For example, a few mouse neuron markers show expression patterns that are more correlated with the human oligodendrocyte-enriched pattern and vice-versa. In conclusion, our work provides insights into human brain function and evolution by probing global relationships between regional cell type marker expression patterns in the human and mouse brain.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Tan, Powell Patrick Cheng; French, Leon; Pavlidis, Paul, 2013, \"Neuron-enriched gene expression patterns are regionally anti-correlated with oligodendrocyte-enriched patterns in the adult mouse and human brain\", http://hdl.handle.net/11272/10578 University of British Columbia [Distributor] V3 [Version]","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Tan PPC, French L, Pavlidis P. \"Neuron-Enriched Gene Expression Patterns are Regionally Anti-Correlated with Oligodendrocyte-Enriched Patterns in the Adult Mouse and Human Brain.\" Frontiers in Neuroscience. 2013;7:5. doi:10.3389/fnins.2013.00005.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Bioinformatics Graduate Program, Centre for High-Throughput Biology, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for High-Throughput Biology and Department of Psychiatry, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for High-Throughput Biology and Department of Psychiatry, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Tan, Powell Patrick Cheng","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"French, Leon","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Pavlidis, Paul","metadata-type":"element"},{"prodPlac":"Vancouver, BC","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"cell type","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"evolution","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"gene expression pattern","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"glia","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"neuron","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"transcriptome","metadata-type":"element"},{"producer":"Centre for High-Throughput Biology\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"producer":"Department of Psychiatry\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"prodDate":"2013","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2018","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Neuron-enriched gene expression patterns are regionally anti-correlated with oligodendrocyte-enriched patterns in the adult mouse and human brain","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":727,"uri":"/icpsr/36046.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/36046.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F36046.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/36046.xml\")/codeBook/stdyDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Facing"}," ",{"highlight":"Fate"},": ",{"highlight":"Estimates"}," of Longevity from Facial Appearance and their Underlying Cues "]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"We examined whether life longevity could be predicted from facial appearance.

Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered in\n the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Exposure to Violence (Subject)\n Completed between 1994 and 1997, the Exposure to Violence (ETV)\n instrument was completed by subjects belonging to Cohorts 9 to 18 of\n the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort Study.

With the release of the survey results only 10 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Employment and Social Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. The census metropolitan area (CMA) variable has been expanded from the three largest CMAs in Canada to nine. Two occupation variables based on the 2016 National Occupation Classicifcation have been reintroduced: a generic 10- category variable (NOC_10) and a detailed 40-category variable (NOC_40). A new variable on immigrant status (IMMIG) has been introduced, which distingushes between recent immigrants and established immigrants. Fourteen variables related to family and spouse/partner's labour force characteristics have been removed, as well as eight out of date variables which have been removed from the record layout.areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver). This is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2019.

This will be achieved by monitoring, over time, a group of people who represent those affected by Katrina. The Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group consists of a broad cross-section of people affected by Katrina, including separate samples of people who resided in the New Orleans metropolitan area at the time of the hurricane and those who resided in the counties or parishes of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi that were in the path of the hurricane. Follow-up interviews conducted with the Advisory Group members to monitor the pace of recovery, as well as reports prepared for policy-makers, press releases, and digitally recorded oral histories are being posted on the Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group  Web site as they become available.

A set of questions regarding Dick Cheney, the\nRepublican Party vice presidential candidate, was posed, including\nwhether respondents were glad that George W. Bush named Cheney as his\nrunning mate, whether Cheney's personality influenced their decision\non taking part in the election, and whether Cheney had the experience\nnecessary to be a good vice president. Those polled expressed their\nopinions about Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George W. Bush, Ralph Nader, Pat\nBuchanan, and Dick Cheney, as well as about their respective\nparties. Information was elicited on respondents' participation and\ncandidate selection in the 1996 presidential election and in the 1998\nHouse of Representatives election.

The survey consists of two separate components:\n(1) a quarterly Interview Survey in which each consumer unit in the\nsample is interviewed every three months over a 15-month period, and\n(2) a Diary Survey completed by the sample consumer units for two\nconsecutive one-week periods. The Interview Survey was designed to\ncollect data on major items of expense, household characteristics, and\nincome. The expenditures covered by the survey are those that\nrespondents can recall fairly accurately for three months or longer. In\ngeneral, these expenditures include relatively large purchases, such as\nthose for property, or expenditures that occur on a fairly regular\nbasis, such as rent, utilities, or insurance premiums. Excluded are\nnonprescription drugs, household supplies, and personal care items. The\nConsumer Unit Characteristics and Income (FMLY) files in this\ncollection contain consumer unit characteristics, consumer unit income,\nand characteristics and earnings of both the reference person and the\nspouse. Summary expenditure data are also provided. The Member\nCharacteristics and Income (MEMB) files present selected\ncharacteristics for each consumer unit member, including reference\nperson and spouse. Each record in the FMLY and MEMB files consists of\nthree months of data. Detailed Expenditures (MTAB) files provide\nmonthly data at the Universal Classification Code (UCC) level. In these\nfiles expenditures for each consumer unit are classified according to\nUCC categories and are specified as gifts or nongifts. There may be\nmore than one record for a UCC in a single month if that is what was\nreported to the interviewer. The Income (ITAB) files supply monthly\ndata at the UCC level for consumer unit characteristics and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Labor.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Statistique Canada.
